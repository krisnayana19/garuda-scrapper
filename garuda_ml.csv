Software Defect Prediction Using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique and Extreme Learning Machine, 20 Feb 2020,"Software testing is one of the crucial processes in software development life cycle which will influence the software quality. One of the strategies to help testing process is predicting the part or module of software which is prone to defect. Then, the testing process can be more focused to those parts. In this research a classifier model for predicting software defect was built. One of the most important problems in software defect prediction is imbalance data distribution between samples of positive class (prone to defect) and of negative class. Therefore, in this research SMOTE is implemented to handle imbalance data problem and extreme learning machine is implemented as a classification algorithm. As a comparison to SMOTE-ELM, a modification of ELM which directly copes with imbalance problem, weighted-ELM, is also observed. This research used NASA MDP dataset PC1, PC2, PC3 and PC4. The results of experiment using 10-fold cross validation show that directly classification using ELM obtain the worse result compared to SMOTE-ELM and weighted-ELM. When the value of imbalance ratio is not very small, the SMOTE-ELM is better than weighted-ELM. When the value of imbalance ratio is very small, the g-mean of weighted-ELM is higher than the g-mean of SMOTE-ELM, but the accuracy of weighted-ELM is lower than the accuracy of SMOTE-ELM. Therefore, in this software defect prediction case it can be concluded that SMOTE is effective to increase the generalization performance of classifier in minority class as long as the value of imbalance ratio is not very small.",Journal of Telematics and Informatics,IAES Indonesia Section and Partners,Khadijah Khadijah,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",http://section.iaesonline.com/index.php/JTI,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/65

Prediction of 4f7-4f65d1 transition energy of Eu2+ in oxides based on first-principles calculations and machine learning, 09 Apr 2020,"In order to establish a method to predict the 4f7-4f65d1 transition energy of Eu2+ in oxides, linear regression models were created based on first-principles calculations and machine learning. The model clusters consisting of the central Eu2+ and O2- ions closer than the nearest cation were constructed and the 4f7-4f65d1 absorption energy of Eu2+ in these clusters were calculated by first-principles many-electron calculation using the relativistic discrete variational multi-electron (DVME) method. However, the 4f7-4f65d1 absorption energies of Eu2+ in oxides calculated by relatively simple first-principles calculations tend to be overestimated by ca. 1.6 eV. In order to improve the accuracy of the prediction, we performed machine learning considering the calculated absorption energy as well as the other electronic and structural parameters as the attributes. As a result, the regression formula to predict the 4f7-4f65d1 absorption energy of Eu2+ in oxides has been created by machine learning. The 4f7-4f65d1 absorption energy predicted by this model are in good agreement with the experimental ones. Therefore, accuracy of the prediction was significantly improved compared to the simple first-principles calculations.

Machine Learning-Based Distributed Denial of Service Attack Detection on Intrusion Detection System Regarding to Feature Selection, 19 Feb 2020,"Distributed Service Denial (DDoS) is a type of network attack, which each year increases in volume and intensity.  DDoS attacks also form part of the major types of cyber security threats so far. Early detection plays a key role in avoiding the catastrophic effects on server infrastructure from DDoS attacks. Detection techniques in the traditional Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are far from perfect compared to a number of modern techniques and tools used by attackers, because the traditional IDS only uses signature-based detection or anomaly-based detection models and causes a lot of false positive flags, since the flow of computer network data packets has complex properties in terms of both size and source.

Face recognition can provide the most natural interaction experience similar to the way humans can recognize others. This paper presents a performance comparison of various machine learning approaches and feature extraction algorithms. The feature extraction algorithm used is Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and a combination of PCA-LDA. The method used is to take a dataset sample and then evaluate and compare machine learning algorithms to analyze accuracy in recognizing faces. We also use feature extraction techniques on facial image capture to speed up data processing. The classification algorithms measured are k-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, support vector machine, random forest, and gradient boosting. The results showed that the random forest classification algorithm was the most accurate face recognition method. On the other hand, the PCA-LDA combined feature extraction algorithm has lower false-negative and false-positive rates than PCA and LDA.

Machine learning-based energy consumption modeling and comparison of H.264/AVC and google VP8 encoders, 01 Apr 2021,"Advancement of the prediction models used in a variety of fields is a result of the contribution of machine learning approaches. Utilizing such modeling in feature engineering is exceptionally imperative and required. In this research, we show how to utilize machine learning to save time in research experiments, where we save more than five thousand hours of measuring the energy consumption of encoding recordings. Since measuring the energy consumption has got to be done by humans and since we require more than eleven thousand experiments to cover all the combinations of video sequences, video bit_rate, and video encoding settings, we utilize machine learning to model the energy consumption utilizing linear regression. VP8 codec has been offered by Google as an open video encoder in an effort to replace the popular MPEG-4 Part 10, known as H.264/AVC video encoder standard. This research model energy consumption and describes the major differences between H.264/AVC and VP8 encoders in terms of energy consumption and performance through experiments that are based on machine learning modeling. Twenty-nine raw video sequences are used, offering a wide range of resolutions and contents, with the frame sizes ranging from QCIF(176x144) to 2160p(3840x2160). For fairness in comparison analysis, we use seven settings in VP8 encoder and fifteen types of tuning in H.264/AVC. The settings cover various video qualities.

Abstract: Machine learning is a system that is able to learn on its own to decide something without having to be repeatedly programmed by humans so that computers become smarter in learning from the experience of the data they have. Based on the learning technique, supervised learning can be distinguished using a dataset (training data) that is already labeled, while unsupervised learning draws conclusions based on the dataset. The input in the form of a dataset is used by machine learning to produce the correct analysis. The problem to be solved by iris flowers (iris tectorum), which has flowers of various colors and has sepals and petals that indicate the species of flowers, requires an appropriate method for grouping these flowers into iris-setosa, iris-versicolor or iris-virginica species. The solution is used by Python, which provides the algorithms and libraries used to make machine learning. The solution with the supervised learning technique was chosen by the KNN Clasiffier algorithm and the unsupervised learning technique was selected by the DBSCAN Clustering algorithm. The results obtained by Python provide a complete library of numPy, Pandas, matplotlib, sklearn to create machine learning programming with KNN algorithms calling from sklearn import neighbors including supervised techniques, and DBSCAN calling from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN including unsupervised learning techniques.

Prediction of Solar Radiation Intensity using Extreme Learning Machine, 01 Nov 2018,"The generated energy capacity at a solar power plant depends on the availability of solar radiation. In some regions, solar radiation is not always available throughout the day, or even week, depending on the weather and climate in the area. To be able to produce energy optimally throughout the year, the availability of solar radiation needs to be predicted based on the weather and climate behavior data. Many methods have been so far used to predict the availability of solar radiation, either by mathematical approach, statistical probability, or even artificial intelligence-based methods. This paper describes a method of predicting the availability of solar radiation using the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) method. It is based on the artificial intelligence methods and known to have a good prediction accuracy. To measure the performance of the ELM method, a conventional forecasting method using the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) method has been used as a comparison. The implementation of both the ELM and MLR methods has been tested using the solar radiation data of the Basel City, Switzerland, which are available to public. Five years of data have been divided into training data and testing data for 6 case-studies considered. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) have been used as the parameters to measure the prediction results based on the actual data analysis. The results show that the obtained average values of RMSE and MAE by using the ELM method respectively are 122.45 W/m2 and 84.04 W/m2, while using the MLR method they are 141.18 W/m2 and 104.87 W/m2 respectively. It means that the ELM method proved to perform better than the MLR method, giving 15.29% better value of RMSE parameter and 24.79% better value of MAE parameter.",Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,Hadi Suyono,,http://ijeecs.iaescore.com/index.php/IJEECS,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6

The experimental results show that the accuracy of the optimized RBF-ELM is 95.71% and 94.27% in the healthy subjects and the amputees, respectively. Meanwhile, the optimization using PSO only attained the average accuracy of 95.53 %, and 92.55 %, on the healthy subjects and the amputees, respectively. The experimental results also show that SW-RBF-ELM achieved the accuracy that is better than other well-known classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and k-nearest neighbor (kNN).",International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,Khairul Anam,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",http://ijece.iaescore.com/index.php/IJECE,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6
Image processing and machine learning techniques used in computer-aided detection system for mammogram screening - a review, 01 Jun 2020,"This paper aims to review the previously developed Computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for mammogram screening because increasing death rate in women due to breast cancer is a global medical issue and it can be controlled only by early detection with regular screening. Till now mammography is the widely used breast imaging modality. CAD systems have been adopted by the radiologists to increase the accuracy of the breast cancer diagnosis by avoiding human errors and experience related issues. This study reveals that in spite of the higher accuracy obtained by the earlier proposed CAD systems for breast cancer diagnosis, they are not fully automated. Moreover, the false-positive mammogram screening cases are high in number and over-diagnosis of breast cancer exposes a patient towards harmful overtreatment for which a huge amount of money is being wasted. In addition, it is also reported that the mammogram screening result with and without CAD systems does not have noticeable difference, whereas the undetected cancer cases by CAD system are increasing. Thus, future research is required to improve the performance of CAD system for mammogram screening and make it completely automated.",International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,Susama Bagchi,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",http://ijece.iaescore.com/index.php/IJECE,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6
The classification of the modern arabic poetry using machine learning, 01 Oct 2019,"In recent years, working on text classification and analysis of Arabic texts using machine learning has seen some progress, but most of this research has not focused on Arabic poetry. Because of some difficulties in the analysis of Arabic poetry, it was required the use of standard Arabic language on which “Al Arud”, the science of studying poetry is based. This paper presents an approach that uses machine learning for the classification of modern Arabic poetry into four types: love poems, Islamic poems, social poems, and political poems. Each of these species usually has features that indicate the class of the poem. Despite the challenges generated by the difficulty of the rules of the Arabic language on which this classification depends, we proposed a new automatic way of modern Arabic poems classification to solve these issues. The recommended method is suitable for the above-mentioned classes of poems. This study used Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Linear Support Vector for the classification processes. Data preprocessing was an important step of the approach in this paper, as it increased the accuracy of the classification.",Perfecting a Video Game with Game Metrics,Universitas Ahmad Dahlan,Munef Abdullah Ahmed,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",http://journal.uad.ac.id/index.php/TELKOMNIKA,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/8

A technical review and comparative analysis of machine learning techniques for intrusion detection systems in MANET, 01 Jun 2020,"Machine learning techniques are being widely used to develop an intrusion detection system (IDS) for detecting and classifying cyber attacks at the network-level and the host-level in a timely and automatic manner. However, Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), based on traditional machine learning methods, lacks reliability and accuracy. Instead of the traditional machine learning used in previous researches, we think deep learning has the potential to perform better in extracting features of massive data considering the massive cyber traffic in real life. Generally Mobile Ad Hoc Networks have given the low physical security for mobile devices, because of the properties such as node mobility, lack of centralized management and limited bandwidth. To tackle these security issues, traditional cryptography schemes can-not completely safeguard MANETs in terms of novel threats and vulnerabilities, thus by applying Deep learning methods techniques in IDS are capable of adapting the dynamic environments of MANETs and enables the system to make decisions on intrusion while continuing to learn about their mobile environment. An IDS in MANET is a sensoring mechanism that monitors nodes and network activities in order to detect malicious actions and malicious attempt performed by Intruders. Recently, multiple deep learning approaches have been proposed to enhance the performance of intrusion detection system. In this paper, we made a systematic comparison of three models, Inceprtion architecture convolutional neural network Inception-CNN, Bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) and deep belief network (DBN) on the deep learning-based intrusion detection systems, using the NSL-KDD dataset containing information about intrusion and regular network connections, the goal is to provide basic guidance on the choice of deep learning methods in MANET.",International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,Safaa laqtib,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",http://ijece.iaescore.com/index.php/IJECE,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6

Classification of Heart Rate Data Using BFO-KFCM Clustering and Improved Extreme Learning Machine Classifier, 01 Mar 2017,"An Electrocardiogram or ECG is an electrical recording of the heart and is used in the investigation of heart disease. The heart rate varies not only in relation to the cardiac demand but is also affected by the presence of cardiac disease and diabetes. Furthermore, it has been shown that Heart Rate Variability (HRV) may be used as an early indicator of cardiac disease susceptibility and the presence of diabetes. Therefore, the heart rate variability may be used for early clinical screening of these diseases. The generalization performance of the SVM classifier is not sufficient for the correct classification of heart rate data. To overcome this problem the Improved Extreme Learning Machine (IELM) classifier is used which works by searching for the best value of the parameters, and upstream by looking for the best subset of features using Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) that feed the classifier. In this work, nine linear and nonlinear features are extracted from the HRV signals. After the preprocessing, feature extraction is done along with feature selection using BFO for data reduction. Then, proposed a scheme to integrate Kernel Fuzzy C-Means (KFCM) clustering and Classifier to improve the accuracy result for ECG beat classification.

Efficient Computer Intrusion Detection Method based on Artificial Bee Colony Optimized Kernel Extreme Learning Machine, 01 Mar 2014,"With continuous development of computer networks, network attacks threat the information security of people’s daily life. For the protection against network intrusion behaviors, it is imperative to search efficient measurements to maintaining network security. Literature review indicates that taking the advantages of neural network, the network intrusion can be efficiently detected and the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) can provide quick and accurate intrusion detection ability. The only parameter need be determined in KELM is the neuron number of hidden layer. Suitable neuron number will accelerate the training procedure. However, little work has been done to address the optimization of KELM. To address this issue, this paper proposed an effective method that uses the artificial bee colony (ABC) to optimize the KELM. With proper hidden layer neuron number, KELM could enhance the accuracy and speed of the intrusion detection. To verify the proposed method, experimental tests have been implemented in this work. The test result demonstrates that the proposed ABC-KELM can detect the network intrusion efficiently and its performance is superior to unoptimized KELM method. DOI : http://dx.doi.org/10.11591/telkomnika.v12i3.4400",Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,Zhigang Zhang,,http://ijeecs.iaescore.com/index.php/IJEECS,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6

Forensic Volatile Memory For Malware Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithm, 14 Jun 2019,"Forensics from volatile memory plays an important role in the investigation of cyber crime. The acquisition of RAM Memory or other terms of RAM dump can assist forensic investigators in retrieving much of the information related to crime. There are various tools available for RAM analysis including Volatility, which currently dominates open source forensic RAM tools. It has happened that many forensic investigators are thinking that they probably have malware in the RAM dump. And, if they do exist, they're still not very capable Malware Analysts, so it's hard for them to analyze the possibilities of malware in a RAM dump. The availability of tools such as Volatility allows forensic investigators to identify and link the various components to conclude whether the crime was committed using malware or not. However, the use of volatility requires knowledge of basic commands as well as static malware analysis. This work is done to assist forensic investigators in detecting and analyzing possible malware from dump RAM. This work is based on the volatility framework and the result is a Forensic tool for analyzing RAM dumps and detecting possible malware in it using machine learning algorithms in order to detect offline (not connected to the internet).",JRSI (Jurnal Rekayasa Sistem dan Industri),Universitas Telkom,"Bahtiar, Fikri","<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",http://jrsi.sie.telkomuniversity.ac.id/index.php/JRSI,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/395

However, the process has problems such as too many classes offered to the student compared to the number of students who take the class or vice versa. Besides that, in the prediction problems, the collected data has an imbalance tendency in each class. As a result, these problems could cause in ineffective scheduling. Thus, there is a need to build a system that can predict students taking courses. However, there are many algorithms that can be used for the prediction. This study compares the performance of algorithms for classifications of students taking courses. In this study, predictions are modeled based on the attributes of student data, namely Grades, GPA, Cumulative GPA, Semester Credits, Cumulative Semester Credits and Semester. The classification process will be carried out to produce a prediction of whether the student takes a particular subject or not.

Forensic Volatile Memory For Malware Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithm, 14 Jun 2019,"Forensics from volatile memory plays an important role in the investigation of cyber crime. The acquisition of RAM Memory or other terms of RAM dump can assist forensic investigators in retrieving much of the information related to crime. There are various tools available for RAM analysis including Volatility, which currently dominates open source forensic RAM tools. It has happened that many forensic investigators are thinking that they probably have malware in the RAM dump. And, if they do exist, they're still not very capable Malware Analysts, so it's hard for them to analyze the possibilities of malware in a RAM dump. The availability of tools such as Volatility allows forensic investigators to identify and link the various components to conclude whether the crime was committed using malware or not. However, the use of volatility requires knowledge of basic commands as well as static malware analysis. This work is done to assist forensic investigators in detecting and analyzing possible malware from dump RAM. This work is based on the volatility framework and the result is a Forensic tool for analyzing RAM dumps and detecting possible malware in it using machine learning algorithms in order to detect offline (not connected to the internet).",JRSI (Jurnal Rekayasa Sistem dan Industri),Universitas Telkom,Fikri Bahtiar,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",http://jrsi.sie.telkomuniversity.ac.id/index.php/JRSI,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/395

Obfuscated computer virus detection using machine learning algorithm, 01 Dec 2019,"Nowadays, computer virus attacks are getting very advanced. New obfuscated computer virus created by computer virus writers will generate a new shape of computer virus automatically for every single iteration and download. This constantly evolving computer virus has caused significant threat to information security of computer users, organizations and even government. However, signature based detection technique which is used by the conventional anti-computer virus software in the market fails to identify it as signatures are unavailable. This research proposed an alternative approach to the traditional signature based detection method and investigated the use of machine learning technique for obfuscated computer virus detection. In this work, text strings are used and have been extracted from virus program codes as the features to generate a suitable classifier model that can correctly classify obfuscated virus files. Text string feature is used as it is informative and potentially only use small amount of memory space. Results show that unknown files can be correctly classified with 99.5% accuracy using SMO classifier model.

Classifier used in this reserach is ELM implemeted on RBFN. Dataset used are GCM (16.063 genes, 14 classes) and Subtypes-Leukemia (12.600 genes, 7 classes). Testing process is done by randomly dividing the training and testing data ten times with same proprotion of training and testing data. The perfomance of classifier built in this research is not so good for GCM dataset, shown by accuracy 75% ± 6,25% and mean of minimum sensitivity 15% ± 19,95%. The low minimum sensitivity indicate that there are few classes that have low sensitivity. But the classifier for Subtypes-Leukemia dataset give better result, that is accuracy 87,68% ± 2,88%  and mean of minimum sensitivity 51,90% ± 20,29%.    Keywords— microarray, gene expression, DWT, ELM, RBFN",IJCCS (Indonesian Journal of Computing and Cybernetics Systems),Universitas Gadjah Mada,Khadijah Khadijah,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/ijccs,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/13

KOMPARASI METODE KOMBINASI SELEKSI FITUR DAN MACHINE LEARNING K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR PADA DATASET LABEL HOURS SOFTWARE EFFORT ESTIMATION, 02 Oct 2019,"The methods for Software Effort Estimation are divided into two, these methods are grouped into Non Machine Learning (non-ML) and Machine Learning (ML) methods [1]. The k-NN method has the disadvantage of being unable to tolerate irrelevant features and greatly affect the accuracy of k-NN. The k-NN method is also difficult to deal with missing data problems and feature categorization problems such as features that are not relevant, weight features that are not optimal, and the same features [2]. Whereas the dataset of Software Effort Estimation still has some serious challenges such as the characteristics of the data set, which are irrelevant features and the level of influence of each feature in the estimated data of the software effort [3]. This study compared the k-NN individual method with the combination of feature selection method with k-NN to find out which method was the best. The results showed that the Forward Selection (FS) method and Median Weighted Information Gain with k-Nearest Neighbor can overcome the problem of irrelevant features so as to increase accuracy in the RMSE Software Effort Estimation dataset, which is smaller in the Albrecht dataset of 5,953 using the Median method -WIG k-NN, the Miyazaki dataset is 55,421 and Kemerer is 123,081 using the FS k-NN method. The combination of kNN with Feature Selection is proven to be able to improve the estimation results better than kNN individuals. With the FS k-NN method being the best by winning in 2 datasets Miyazaki and Kemerer. ","Explore: Jurnal Sistem Informasi dan Telematika (Telekomunikasi, Multimedia dan Informatika)",Universitas Bandar Lampung,Indra Kurniawan,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/500"">Other</a>",http://jurnal.ubl.ac.id/index.php/explore,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/92
Tomato Growth Stage Monitoring for Smart Farm Using Deep Transfer Learning with Machine Learning-based Maturity Grading, 20 Jan 2020,"The tomato farming industry needs to adopt new ideas in applying the technology for its growth monitoring and main. Machine vision and image processing techniques have become useful in the increasing need for quality inspection of fruits, particularly, tomatoes. This paper deals with the design and development of a computer-vision monitoring system to assess the growth of tomato plants in a chamber by detecting the presence of flowers and fruits. The system also provides maturity grading for the tomato fruit. Two pre-trained deep transfer learning models were used in the study for the detection of flowers and fruits, namely, the Regional-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) and the Single Shot Detector (SDD). Maturity classification of tomato fruits are implemented using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Evaluation results show that for the detection of flowers and fruits, the over-all accuracy of the R-CNN is 1.67% for flower detection and 19.48% for the fruit detection while SSD registered 100% and 95.99% for flower and fruit detection respectively. In the machine learning for maturity grading, SVM produced the training-testing accuracy rate of 97.78%-99.81%, KNN with 93.78%-99.32%, and ANN with 91.33%-99.32%.","AGRIVITA, Journal of Agricultural Science",Universitas Brawijaya,"de Luna, Robert G.","<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/20"">Agriculture, Biological Sciences &amp; Forestry</a>",https://agrivita.ub.ac.id/index.php/agrivita,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/28
"Size Classification of Tomato Fruit Using Thresholding, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning Techniques", 28 Oct 2019,"The size of tomato fruits is closely related to the market segment and price. Manual sorting in tomato is very dependent on human interpretation and thus, very prone to error.  The study presents thresholding, machine learning, and deep learning techniques in classifying the tomato as small, medium, and large based from a single tomato fruit image implemented using Open CV libraries and Python programming. Tomato images with different sizes are gathered where features like area, perimeter, and enclosed circle radius are extracted. The experiment shows that using thresholding, a classification accuracy of 85.83%, 65.83%, and 80% was achieved for area, perimeter, and enclosed circle radius, respectively. For machine learning, the training accuracy rates were recorded as 94.00%-95.00% for SVM, 97.50-92.50% for KNN and 90.33-92.50% for ANN. Comparison of models revealed that SVM is the most model without over fitting. The deep learning approach, regardless of the algorithm, produced low performances with 82.31%-78.21%-55.97% training-validation-testing accuracy for VGG16, 48.17%-41.44%-37.64% for InceptionV3, and 56.05%-44.96%-22.78% for ResNet50 models.

Multilingual twitter sentiment analysis using machine learning, 01 Dec 2020,"Twitter sentiment analysis is one of the leading research fields. Most of the researchers were contributed to twitter sentiment analysis in English tweets, but few researchers focus on the multilingual twitter sentiment analysis. Some challenges are hoping for the research solutions in multilingual twitter sentiment analysis. This study presents the implementation of sentiment analysis in multilingual twitter data and improves the data classification up to the adequate level of accuracy. Twitter is the sixth leading social networking site in the world. Active users for twitter in a month are 330 million. People can tweet or re-tweet in their languages and allow users to use emoji’s, abbreviations, contraction words, miss spellings, and shortcut words. The best platform for sentiment analysis is twitter. Multilingual tweets and data sparsity are the two main challenges. In this paper, the MLTSA algorithm gives the solution for these two challenges. MLTSA algorithm divides into two parts. One is detecting and translating non-English tweets into English using natural language processing (NLP). And the second one is an appropriate pre-processing method with NLP support can reduce the data sparsity. The result of the MLTSA with SVM achieves good accuracy by up to 95%.",International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,K.

Reduction of transients in switches using embedded machine learning, 01 Mar 2020,"Non-linear loads can cause transients in electronic switches. They also result in a fluctuating output when the device is switched ON or OFF. These transients can harm not only the switches but also the devices that they are connected to, by passing excess currents or voltages to the devices. By applying machine learning, we can improve the gate drive voltages of the switches and thereby reduce switch transients. A feedback system is built that measures the output transients and then feeds it to a neural network algorithm that then gives a proper gate drive to the device. This will reduce transients and also improve performances of switch based devices like inverters and converters.",International Journal of Power Electronics and Drive Systems (IJPEDS),Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,P.

Machine Learning Models Based on Random Forest Feature Selection and Bayesian Optimization for Predicting Daily Global Solar Radiation, 01 Feb 2022,"Prediction of daily global solar radiation Â with simple and highly accurate models would be beneficial for solar energy conversion systems. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid machine learning methodology integrating two feature selection methods and a Bayesian optimization algorithm to predict H in the city of Fez, Morocco. First, we identified the most significant predictors using two Random Forest methods of feature importance: Mean Decrease in Impurity (MDI) and Mean Decrease in Accuracy (MDA). Then, based on the feature selection results, ten models were developed and compared: (1) five standalone machine learning (ML) models including Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forests (RF), Bagged Trees Regression (BTR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP); and (2) the same models tuned by the Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm: CART-BO, RF-BO, BTR-BO, SVR-BO, and MLP-BO. Both MDI and MDA techniques revealed that extraterrestrial solar radiation and sunshine duration fraction were the most influential features. The BO approach improved the predictive accuracy of MLP, CART, SVR, and BTR models and prevented the CART model from overfitting. The best improvements were obtained using the MLP model, where RMSE and MAE were reduced by 17.6% and 17.2%, respectively. Among the studied models, the SVR-BO algorithm provided the best trade-off between prediction accuracy (RMSE=0.4473kWh/mÂ²/day, MAE=0.3381kWh/mÂ²/day, and RÂ²=0.9465), stability (with a 0.0033kWh/mÂ²/day increase in RMSE), and computational cost.",International Journal of Renewable Energy Development,Universitas Diponegoro,"Chaibi, Mohamed","<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/45"">Chemistry</a>",https://ejournal.undip.ac.id/index.php/ijred,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/7

On the benefit of logic-based machine learning to learn pairwise comparisons, 01 Dec 2020,"In recent years, many daily processes such as internet web searching, e-mail filter-ing, social media services, e-commerce have benefited from machine learning tech-niques (ML). The implementation of ML techniques has been largely focused on blackbox methods where the general conclusions are not easily interpretable. Hence, theelaboration with other declarative software models to identify the correctness and com-pleteness of the models is not easy to perform. On the other hand, the emerge of somelogic-based machine learning techniques with their advantage of white box approachhave been proven to be well-suited for many software engineering tasks. In this paper,we propose the use of a logic-based approach to learn user preference in the form ofpairwise comparisons. APARELL as a novel approach of inductive learning is able tomodel the user’s preferences in description logic representation. This offers a rich, re-lational representation which is then can be used to produce a set of recommendations.A user study has been performed in our experiment to evaluate the implementation ofpairwise preference recommender system when compared to a standard list interface.The result of the experiment shows that the pairwise interface was significantly betterthan the other interface in many ways.",Bulletin of Electrical Engineering and Informatics,Universitas Ahmad Dahlan,Nunung Nurul Qomariyah,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/100"">Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineering</a>",http://beei.org/index.php/EEI,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/8
Marine Vessel Telemetry Data Processing Using Machine Learning, 18 Sep 2019,"In Indonesia, one of the causes of the high cost of fuel in the shipping industry is theft and misuse of fuel. This happened because ship management center unable to monitor all the activities of the ship when the ship sailing in the middle of the ocean. Lately, ship monitoring through the latest technology are being carried out, one of which is the Machine to Machine (M2M) based Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) technology. The development of VMS and telemetry technology has enabled monitoring of engines and fuel consumption of ships in real time. The problem with this VMS system is that there is still a dependency on the analysis of experts who need a long time to analyze various parameters of existing telemetry data, which lead to inaccuracy and delay in anomaly detection. This study conducted a statistical analysis of telemetry data, especially in ship movement and machine activities, and then designed the fuel consumption regularity classification system with the Naive Bayes and Logistics Regression. Naive Bayes method was chosen because it can produce maximum accuracy with little training data, and Logistics Regression was chosen for its simplicity and excellent results in prediction of numerical and discrete data. The results of this study indicate that telemetry data from the VMS system can be used to detect irregularities in Fuel consumption. Tested with selected data, Naive Bayes classification accuracy in irregularities detection is up to 92% while logistic regression is up to 96%.",Proceeding of the Electrical Engineering Computer Science  and Informatics,IAES Indonesia Section and Partners,"Susanto, Herry","<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",http://journal.portalgaruda.org/index.php/EECSI,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/65

Method to implement K-NN machine learning to classify data privacy in IoT environment, 01 Nov 2020,"Internet of Things technology allows many devices to connect with each other. The interaction could be between humans and devices or between devices itself. In fact, the data are traveling between the devices through the media within the boundary, and it could be traveling outside the boundary when it required to be analyzed or stored in the cloud through the internet. Due the transmission media and internet, the data are vulnerable to attacks. Thus, the data need to be encrypted strongly for the purpose of protection. Usually, most of the encryption techniques will consume computer resources. In this work, we divide the data that are used in the IoT environment into three levels of sensitivity which are low, medium and high sensitive data to leverage the computer resources such as time of encryption and decryption, battery usage and so on. A framework is proposed in this work to encrypt the data depends on the level of sensitivity using the machine learning K nearest neighbors (K-NN).",Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,Qahtan Makki Shallal,,http://ijeecs.iaescore.com/index.php/IJEECS,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6

Software Aging Prediction Based on Extreme Learning Machine, 01 Nov 2013,"In the research on software aging and rejuvenation, one of the most important questions is when to trigger the rejuvenation action. And it is useful to predict the system resource utilization state efficiently for determining the rejuvenation time. In this paper, we propose software aging prediction model based on extreme learning machine (ELM) for a real VOD system. First, the data on the parameters of system resources and application server are collected. Then, the data is preprocessed by normalization and principal component analysis (PCA). Then, ELMs are constructed to model the extracted data series of systematic parameters. Finally, we get the predicted data of system resource by computing the sum of the outputs of these ELMs. Experiments show that the proposed software aging prediction method based on wavelet transform and ELM is superior to the artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) in the aspects of prediction precision and efficiency. Based on the models employed here, software rejuvenation policies can be triggered by actual measurements. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.11591/telkomnika.v11i11.3495",Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,Xiaozhi Du,,http://ijeecs.iaescore.com/index.php/IJEECS,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6
Detailed Analysis of Extrinsic Plagiarism Detection System Using Machine Learning Approach (Naive Bayes and SVM), 01 Nov 2014,"In this report we proposed a detailed analysis method of plagiarism detection system using machine learning approach. We used Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as learning algorithms. Learning features used in the method are words similarity, fingerprints similarity, latent semantic analysis (LSA) similarity, and word pair. The purpose in selecting those features is to retrieve information from the state-of-the-art detailed analysis methods (words similarity, fingerprinting, and LSA) in order to integrate the strength of each method in detecting plagiarism. Several experiments were conducted to test the performance of the proposed method in detecting many cases of plagiarism. The experiments used data test that contains cases of literal plagiarism, partial literal plagiarism, paraphrased plagiarism, plagiarism with changed sentence structure, and translated plagiarism. The data test also contains cases of non-plagiarism of different topics and non-plagiarism of the same topic. The results obtained in experiments using SVM showed an average accuracy of 92.86% (reaching 95.71% without using words similarity feature). While the result obtained using Naive Bayes showed an average accuracy of 54.29% (reaching 84.29% without using the word pair features).",Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,Zakiy Firdaus Alfikri,,http://ijeecs.iaescore.com/index.php/IJEECS,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6
Neuro-physiological porn addiction detection using machine learning approach, 01 Nov 2019,"Pornography is a portrayal of sexual subject contents for the exclusive purpose of sexual arousal that can lead to addiction. The availability and easy accessibility of the Internet connectivity have created unprecedented opportunities for sexual education, learning, and growth for adolescences to be in the rise. Hence, the risk of porn addiction developed by teenagers has also increased due to highly prevalent porn consumption. To date, the only available means of detecting porn addiction is through questionnaire. However, while answering the questions, participants may suppress or exaggerate their answers because porn addiction is considered taboo in the community. Hence, the purpose of this project is to develop an engine with multiple classifiers to recognize porn addiction using electroencephalography (EEG) signals and to compare classifiers performance. In the experimental study, the neuro-physiological signals of EEG data were collected previously in Indonesia among students age 9 to 13 years old by researchers from the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). The EEG data were pre-processed, and relevant features are extracted using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). Then, the features are classified to produce the outputs of valance and arousal. Subsequently, three different classifiers of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Naive Bayesian (NB), and Random Forest (RF) are employed to determine whether the participant is a porn addict or otherwise. The experimental results show that the MLP classifier yields slightly better accuracy compared to Naïve Bayes and Random Forest classifiers making the MLP classifier preferable for porn addiction recognition. Although this work is still at infancy stage, it is envisaged for the work to be expanded for comprehensive porn addiction recognition system so that early intervention and appropriate support can be given for the teenagers with pornography addiction problem.",Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,Norhaslinda Kamaruddin,,http://ijeecs.iaescore.com/index.php/IJEECS,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6
I-OnAR: a rule-based machine learning approach for intelligent assessment in an online learning environment, 01 Feb 2020,"Intelligent systems are created to automate decision making process that is similar to human intelligence. Incorporating intelligent component has achieved promising results in many applications, including in education. Intelligence modules in a tutoring system would bring the application and its capability closer to a human's ability to serve its human users and to solve problems. However, the majority of the online learning provided in the literature review especially in Malaysia, normally only provide the lecture notes, assignments and tests and rarely suggest or give feedbacks on what the students should study or do next in order to fully understand the subjects. Hence, the researchers propose an online learning environment called Intelligent Online Assessment and Revision (I-OnAR). It facilitates the learning process at multiple learning phases such as test creation, materials revision, feedback for improvement and performance analysis. These components are incorporated into the tutoring system to assist self-pace learning at anytime and anywhere. The intelligent agent uses a Rule-based Machine Learning method for the adaptive capabilities such as automated test creation and feedbacks for improvement. The system has been tested on a group of students and found to be useful to support learning process. The results have shown that 60% of the subjects’ performance have improved with the help of the system. The students were given feedbacks on the topic they did poorly as well as how to improve their performance. This proves that the Intelligent Online Assessment and revision (I-OnAR) can be a useful tool to help online students intelligently, systematically and efficiently. For the future works, the researchers would like to apply the usage of other techniques such as Fuzzy Logic to strengthen the analysis and decision of the current system.",Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,Shaiful Bakhtiar bin Rodzman,,http://ijeecs.iaescore.com/index.php/IJEECS,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6

Analytics of stock market prices based on machine learning algorithms, 01 Nov 2019,"This study focuses on the use of machine learning algorithms to analyse financial news on stock market prices. Stock market prediction is a challenging task because the market is known to be very volatile and dynamic. Investors face these kinds of problems as they do not properly understand which stock product to subscribe or when to sell the product with an optimum profit. Analyzing the information individually or manually is a tedious task as many aspects have to be considered. Five different companies from Bursa Malaysia namely CIMB, Sime Darby, Axiata, Maybank and Petronas were chosen in this study. Two sets of experiments were performed based on different data types. The first experiment employs textual data involving 6368 articles, extracted from financial news that have been classified into positive or negative using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Bags of words and bags of combination words are extracted as the features for the first experiment. The second experiment employs the numeric data type extracted from historical data involving 5321 records to predict whether the stock price is going up (positive) or down (negative) using Random Forest algorithm. The Rain Forest algorithm gives better accuracy in comparison with SVM algorithm with 99% and 68% accuracy respectively.

Lettuce life stage classification from texture attributes using machine learning estimators and feature selection processes, 12 Jul 2020,"Classification of lettuce life or growth stages is an effective tool for measuring the performance of an aquaponics system. It determines the balance in water nutrients, adequate temperature and lighting, other environmental factors, and the system’s productivity to sustain cultivars. This paper proposes a classification of lettuce life stages planted in an aquaponics system. The classification was done using the texture features of the leaves derived from machine vision algorithms. The attributes underwent three different feature selection processes, namely: Univariate Selection (US), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and Feature Importance (FI) to determine the four most significant features from the original eight attributes. The features selected were used for training four estimators from Decision Trees Classifier (DTC), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The models trained using DTC and SGD were then optimized as they have hyperparameters for tuning. A comparative analysis among Machine Learning (ML) algorithms was conducted to identify the best-performing model with the given application. The best features were derived from US and FI as they have the same top four features using the DTC estimator optimized with the hyperparameters tuned to max depth having 5, criterion equated to ‘Gini', and splitter was set to 'Best'.

Enhancement of the Estimation of Energy Consumption for Electric Vehicles by Using Machine Learning, 01 Apr 2021,"Three main classes are considered of significant influence factors when predicting theenergy consumption rate of Electric Vehicles (EV): environment, driver behaviour, and vehicle. These classes take into account constant or variable parameters which influ-ences the energy consumption of the EV. In this paper, we develop a new model taking into account the three classes as well as the interaction between them in order to im-prove the quality of EV energy consumption. The model depends on a new approach based on machine learning and especially k-NN algorithm in order to estimate the EVenergy consumption. Following a lazy learning paradigm, this approach allows better estimation performance. The advantage of our proposal, in regards to mathematical approach, is taking into account the real situation of the ecosystem on the basis of historical data. In fact, the behavior of the driver (driving style, heating usage, air con-ditioner usage, battery state, etc.) impacts directly the EV energy consumption. The obtained results show that we can reach up to 96.5% of accuracy about the estimatedof energy-consumption.

We identify the timespan of forecasting should be long enough to avoid dispatcher's lack of information server distribution at runtime. Additionally, server profile pulling, forecasting server resources, and dispatching should be asynchronous with the request listener of the load balancer to minimize response delay. For production use, we recommend that the load balancer should have friendly user interface to make it easier to be configured, such as adding resources of servers as parameter criteria.

Based on the experiments, we conclude that the recommender produces the most accurate result when the cosine similarity measure is used inside the algorithm. Also, the centralized job recommender system is able to process the data faster compared to the distributed cluster job recommender system. But as the size of the data grows, the centralized system eventually will lack the capacity to process the data, while the distributed cluster job recommender is able to scale according to the size of the data.","Journal of Applied Information, Communication and Technology",Swiss German University,"Dicky, Timothy","<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",https://journal.sgu.ac.id/ejaict/index.php/EJAICT,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/1810

Geospatial Approach for the Analysis of Forest Cover Change Detection using Machine Learning, 30 Dec 2020,"Spatial data classification is famous over recent years in order to extract knowledge and insights into the data. It occurs because vast experimentation was used with various classifiers, and significant improvement was examined in accuracy and performance. This study aimed to analyze forest cover change detection using machine learning. Supervised and unsupervised learning methods were used to analyze spatial data. A Vector machine was used to support the supervised learning, and a neural network method was used to support unsupervised learning. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to identify the bands and extract pixel information relevant to the vegetation. The supervised method shows better results because of its robust performance and better analysis of spatial data classification using vegetation index. The proposed system experimentation was implemented by analyzing the results obtained from Support Vector Machine (SVM) and NN (Neural Network) methods. It is demonstrated in the results that the use of NDVI mainly enhances the performance and increases the classifier's accuracy to a greater extent.

Dynamic composition components based on machine learning: architecture design and process, 01 May 2021,"The dynamic composition of components is an emerging concept that aims to allow a new application to be constructed based on a user’s request. Three main ingredients must be used to achieve the dynamic composition of components: goal, scenario, and context-awareness. These three ingredients must be completed by artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that help process discovery and storage. This paper presents framework architecture for the dynamic composition of components that can extract expressed goals, deduce implicit ones using AI. The goal will be combined with pertinent contextual data, to compose the relevant components that meet the real requirements of the user. The core element of our proposed architecture is the composer component that (i) negotiate user goal, (ii) load the associated scenarios and choose the most suitable one based on user goal and profile, (iii) get binding information of scenario’s actions, (iv) compose the loaded actions, and (v) store the new component as a tree of actions enabled by contextual or process constraint. In our e-learning proven of concept, we consider five components: composer component, reader component, formatter component, matcher component, and executor component. These five components stipulate that a course is the combination of existing/scrapped chapters that have been adapted to a user profile in terms of language, level of difficulty, and prerequisite. The founding result shows that AI is not only an element that enhances system performance in terms of timing response but a crucial ingredient that guides the dynamic composition of components. ",Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,Younes Zouani,,http://ijeecs.iaescore.com/index.php/IJEECS,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6
"MACHINE LEARNING APPLICATION IN RESPONSE TO DISASTER RISK REDUCTION OF FOREST AND PEATLAND FIRE: Impact-Based Learning of DRR for Forest, Land Fire and Peat Smouldering", 30 Dec 2020,"Peat forest is a natural swamp ecosystem containing buried biomass from biomass deposits originating from past tropical swamp vegetation that has not been decomposed. Once it burns, smoldering peat fires consume huge biomass. Peat smoldering fires are challenging to extinguish. These will continuously occur for weeks to months. Experts and practitioners of peat smoldering fires are the most recommended effort to prevent them before they occur with the strategy: 'detect early, locate the fire, deliver the most appropriate technology.' Monitoring methods and early detection of forest and land fires or 'wildfire' have been highly developed and applied in Indonesia, for example, monitoring with hotspot data, FWI (Fire Weather Index), and FDRS (Fire Danger Rating System). These 'physical simulator' based methods have some weaknesses, and soon such methods will be replaced by the Machine Learning method as it is developing recently. What about the potential application of Machine Learning in the forest and land fires, particularly smoldering peat fires in Indonesia? This paper tries to answer this question.

The Empirical Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithm for the Class Imbalanced Problem in Conformational Epitope Prediction, 22 May 2021,"A conformational epitope is a part of a protein-based vaccine. It is challenging to identify using an experiment. A computational model is developed to support identification. However, the imbalance class is one of the constraints to achieving optimal performance on the conformational epitope B cell prediction. In this paper, we compare several conformational epitope B cell prediction models from non-ensemble and ensemble approaches. A sampling method from Random undersampling, SMOTE, and cluster-based undersampling is combined with a decision tree or SVM to build a non-ensemble model. A random forest model and several variants of the bagging method is used to construct the ensemble model. A 10-fold cross-validation method is used to validate the model.  The experiment results show that the combination of the cluster-based under-sampling and decision tree outperformed the other sampling method when combined with the non-ensemble and the ensemble method. This study provides a baseline to improve existing models for dealing with the class imbalance in the conformational epitope prediction.",JUITA : Jurnal Informatika,Universitas Muhammadiyah Purwokerto,Binti Solihah,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",https://jurnalnasional.ump.ac.id/index.php/JUITA,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/26

KLASIFIKASI VARIETAS KOPI BERDASARKAN GREEN BEAN COFFEE MENGGUNAKAN METODE MACHINE LEARNING, 31 Jan 2020,"Kopi memiliki jenis yang terdiri dari kopi robusta dan kopi arabika. Kopi arabika memiliki beragam varietas berdasarkan daerah asal atau dikenal dengan nama single origin. Petani dan coffee expert membedakan varietas kopi arabika melalui bentuk dan karakter dari green bean atau kopi mentah. Perbedaan ciri ini meliputi perbedaan warna, bentuk, atau tekstur. Setiap varietas kopi memiliki harga yang berbeda-beda tergantung dari jenis varietasnya. Walaupun demikian, tidak semua petani, dan pemilik coffee shop mampu mengenali varietas kopi dengan hanya melihat green bean. Sehingga, bisa terjadi kesalahan dalam mengenali varietas kopi jika pemilik coffee shop tidak mengetahui pengetahuan tentang kopi. Hal ini bisa disolusikan dengan pemodelan yang dapat mengidentifikasi varietas kopi arabika agar dapat digunakan sebagai second opinion untuk mengindentifikasi varietas kopi arabika. Salah satu metode yang digunakan adalah metode pencitraan.

A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL FOR SOBRIETY AND RELAPSE ANALYSIS IN DRUG REHABILITATION, 14 Jun 2021,"Drug abuse has become so paramount among members of society. Although, the initial decision to take drugs is typically voluntary among victims. As drugs are constantly been used, the ability to exert self-control on them is relatively impaired. Thus, abuse is witnessed in different age groups, gender, and celebrities from all walks of life. While addicts become such owing to several factors of curiosity and peer pressure, recreational purpose, source of inspiration, and more, the effect of these drugs can lead to depression, brain stimulation, and hallucination. Managing drug abuse through behavioral or pharmacological means is intended to help addicts stop habitual drug use. Oftentimes, rehab is not effective because the desired change is absent while a proper technological-driven approach to track sobriety and relapse in compulsive drug seeking and usage is also missing. Consequently, in this research, user-friendly and interactive sobriety and relapse predictive management application is developed. Here, addicts' behavioral and demographics with major relapse monitoring factors were clustered to predict the likelihood of relapse. The relapse predictive system using cognitive behavioral patterns, adopts the logistic regression algorithm of the Bayesian network for both training and testing. The essence is to ascertain users’ addiction level, analyze and track sobriety and relapse in order to uncover drug addiction patterns, discover the probability of relapse occurrence towards recommending sustainable rehabilitation decision support",IJISCS (International Journal Of Information System and Computer Science),STMIK Pringsewu Lampung,Ayodeji Olusegun Ibitoye,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",http://ojs.stmikpringsewu.ac.id/index.php/ijiscs,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/816

Klasifikasi Gangguan Tidur REM Behaviour Disorder Berdasarkan Sinyal EEG menggunakan Machine Learning, 29 Dec 2020,"REM Behavior Disorder (RBD) is a sleep disorder characterized by the loss of normal muscle atony (loss of paralysis) during Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep, where sufferers act on dreams that can result in physical injury to individuals or their sleep partners. REM is a sleep stage characterized by cessation of eye movement, a decrease in body temperature, slow heart rate and no muscle activity in several parts of the body. One of the methods used to detect RBD is Electroencephalography (EEG). EEG is a method of recording or capturing electrical activity in the brain. The dataset used was sourced from PhysioNet.org which consisted of 2 classes, namely normal class and RBD class which were taken from 26 subjects with 6 normal subjects and 20 RBD subjects. This research was conducted to classify RBD sleep disorders based on EEG signals using the ELM algorithm and it is expected to determine the best algorithm for classifying RBD sleep disorders using the ELM algorithm which will be compared with the SVM and backpropagation algorithms based on the EEG signal in terms of the resulting accuracy value and also the time required. to create a model in the algorithm classification process. Classification of RBD sleep disorders based on EEG signals begins with data pre-processing, feature extraction and classification. Data pre-processing includes signal splitting per 30 seconds and data smoothing. The feature extraction process uses Discrete Wavelet Transformation. The RBD classification process based on EEG signals uses the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm with the binary sigmoid activation function. Prior to the training process on the ELM algorithm, undersampling was first carried out to overcome the imbalance in the number of classes. Evaluation of the classification results is done by using k-fold cross-validation. The classification results of RBD sleep disorders based on EEG signals using the ELM algorithm show that the ELM algorithm can classify RBD and non-RBD sleep disorders based on EEG signals with an average accuracy value of 70.71% ± 5.44. The comparison result states that the backpropagation algorithm has the best average accuracy in RBD classification based on EEG signals, reaching 83.81% ± 1.40. However, based on the computation of time, the ELM algorithm is superior in the speed of the RBD classification process based on EEG signals, reaching 0.04 ± 0.06 seconds compared to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and backpropagation.",Jurnal Sistem Cerdas,Asosiasi Prakarsa Indonesia Cerdas,Alvi Norma Utami,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/30"">Automotive Engineering</a>",https://apic.id/jurnal/index.php/jsc,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/1226

Development of Bot Detection Applications on Twitter Social Media Using Machine Learning with a Random Forest Classifier Algorithm, 29 Dec 2020,"A Twitter bot is a Twitter account programmed to automatically do social activities by sending tweets through a scheduling program. Some bots intend to disseminate useful information such as earthquake and weather information. However, not a few bots have a negative influence, such as broadcasting false news, spam, or become a follower to increase an account's popularity. It can change public sentiments about an issue, decrease user confidence, or even change the social order. Therefore, an application is needed to distinguish between a bot and non-bot accounts. Based on these problems, this paper develops bot detection systems using machine learning for multiclass classification. These classes include human classes, informative, spammers, and fake followers. The model training used guided methods based on labeled training data. First, a dataset of 2,333 accounts was pre-processed to obtain 28 feature sets for classification. This feature set came from analysis of user profiles, temporal analysis, and analysis of tweets with numeric values. Afterward, the data was partitioned, normalized with scaling, and a random forest classifier algorithm was implemented on the data. After that, the features were reselected into 17 feature sets to obtain the highest accuracy achieved by the model. In the evaluation stage, bot detection models generated an accuracy of 96.79%, 97% precision, 96% recall, and an f-1 score of 96%. Therefore, the detection model was classified as having high accuracy. The bot detection model that had been completed was then implemented on the website and deployed to the cloud.

Identification of White Blood Cells Using Machine Learning Classification Based on Feature Extraction, 17 Jun 2021,"In various disease diagnoses, one of the parameters is white blood cells, consisting of eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. Manual identification takes a long time and tends to be subjective depending on the staff's experience, so the automatic identification of white blood cells will be faster and more accurate. White blood cells are identified by examining a colored blood smear (SADT) and examined under a digital microscope to obtain a cell image. Image identification of white blood cells is determined through HSV color space segmentation (Hue, Saturation Value) and feature extraction of the Gray Level Cooccurrence Matrix (GLCM) method using the Angular Second Moment (ASM), Contrast, Entropy, and Inverse Different Moment (IDM) features. The purpose of this study was to identify white blood cells by comparing the classification accuracy of the K-nearest neighbor (KNN), NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classification (NBC), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) methods. The classification results of 100 training data and 50 white blood cell image testing data. Tests on the KNN, NBC, and MLP methods yielded an accuracy of 82%, 80%, and 94%, respectively. Therefore, MLP was chosen as the best classification model in the identification of white blood cells.",JOIN (Jurnal Online Informatika),Universitas Islam Negeri Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung,"Musliman, Anwar Siswanto","<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",http://join.if.uinsgd.ac.id/index.php/join,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/210

Machine learning model for clinical named entity recognition, 01 Apr 2021,"To extract important concepts (named entities) from clinical notes, most widely used NLP task is named entity recognition (NER). It is found from the literature that several researchers have extensively used machine learning models for clinical NER.The most fundamental tasks among the medical data mining tasks are medical named entity recognition and normalization. Medical named entity recognition is different from general NER in various ways. Huge number of alternate spellings and synonyms create explosion of word vocabulary sizes. This reduces the medicine dictionary efficiency. Entities often consist of long sequences of tokens, making harder to detect boundaries exactly. The notes written by clinicians written notes are less structured and are in minimal grammatical form with cryptic short hand. Because of this, it poses challenges in named entity recognition. Generally, NER systems are either rule based or pattern based. The rules and patterns are not generalizable because of the diverse writing style of clinicians. The systems that use machine learning based approach to resolve these issues focus on choosing effective features for classifier building. In this work, machine learning based approach has been used to extract the clinical data in a required manner",International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,Ravikumar J.,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",http://ijece.iaescore.com/index.php/IJECE,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6
A new procedure for misbehavior detection in vehicular ad-hoc networks using machine learning, 01 Jun 2021,"Misbehavior detection in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is performed to improve the traffic safety and driving accuracy. All the nodes in the VANETs communicate to each other through message logs. Malicious nodes in the VANETs can cause inevitable situation by sending message logs with tampered values. In this work, various machine learning algorithms are used to detect the primarily five types of attacks namely, constant attack, constant offset attack, random attack, random offset attack, and eventual attack. Firstly, each attack is detected by different machine learning algorithms using binary classification. Then, the new procedure is created to do the multi classification of the attacks on best chosen algorithm from different machine learning techniques. The highest accuracy in case of binary classification is obtained with Naïve Bayes (100%), decision tree (100%), and random forest (100%) in type1 attack, decision tree (100%) in type2 attack, and random forest (98.03%, 95.56%, and 95.55%) in Type4, Type8 and Type16 attack respectively.

Optimization of network traffic anomaly detection using machine learning, 01 Jun 2021,"In this paper, to optimize the process of detecting cyber-attacks, we choose to propose 2 main optimization solutions: Optimizing the detection method and optimizing features. Both of these two optimization solutions are to ensure the aim is to increase accuracy and reduce the time for analysis and detection. Accordingly, for the detection method, we recommend using the Random Forest supervised classification algorithm. The experimental results in section 4.1 have proven that our proposal that use the Random Forest algorithm for abnormal behavior detection is completely correct because the results of this algorithm are much better than some other detection algorithms on all measures. For the feature optimization solution, we propose to use some data dimensional reduction techniques such as information gain, principal component analysis, and correlation coefficient method. The results of the research proposed in our paper have proven that to optimize the cyber-attack detection process, it is not necessary to use advanced algorithms with complex and cumbersome computational requirements, it must depend on the monitoring data for selecting the reasonable feature extraction and optimization algorithm as well as the appropriate attack classification and detection algorithms.",International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,ChoXuan Do,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",http://ijece.iaescore.com/index.php/IJECE,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6

An algorithm for characterizing skin moles using image processing and machine learning, 01 Aug 2021,"Melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer, forms in cells (melanocytes) that produce melanin, the pigment that gives color to the skin. There are low-income regions that lack specialized dermatologists, causing skin cancer to be diagnosed in advanced stages. In Peru, in high Andean communities with low resources, the problem is aggravated by the high incidence of ultraviolet radiation and lack of medical resources to make the diagnosis. Normally, mole images are obtained from dermatoscopes. The present work seeks to use mole images obtained from smartphones to make the classification of them as suspected or not suspected of being melanoma, by means of a feature extraction algorithm. The first step is to make color and lighting corrections. After this, the image is segmented using the K-Means algorithm, and we obtain the areas of the mole and skin. With the segmented mole we proceed to extract the main visual characteristics and then use classification algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest and naïve bayes, which obtained an accuracy of 0.9473, 0.7368 and 0.6842, respectively.

MRI image segmentation using machine learning networks and level set approaches, 01 Feb 2022,"The segmented brain tissues from magnetic resonance images (MRI) always pose substantive challenges to the clinical researcher community, especially while making precise estimation of such tissues.

A new hybrid deep learning architecture combining SegNet and U-Net techniques to segment brain tissue is proposed here. Here, a skip connection of the concerned U-Net network was suitably explored. The results indicated optimal multi-scale information generated from the SegNet, which was further exploited to obtain precise tissue boundaries from the brain images. Further, in order to ensure that the segmentation method performed better in conjunction with precisely delineated contours, the output is incorporated as the level set layer in the deep learning network. The proposed method primarily focused on analysing brain tumor segmentation (BraTS) 2017 and BraTS 2018, dedicated datasets dealing with MRI brain tumour.

Machine learning based multi class fault diagnosis tool for voltage source inverter driven induction motor, 01 Jun 2021,"AC drives are employed in process industries for varying applications resulting in a wide range of ratings. The entire process industry has seen a paradigm shift from manual to automated systems. The major factor contributing to this is the advanced power electronics technology enabling power electronic drives for smooth control of electric motors. Induction motors are most commonly used in industries. Faults in the power electronic circuits may occur periodically. These faults often go unnoticed as they rarely cause a complete shutdown and the fault levels may not be large enough to lead to a breakdown of the drive. An early detection of these faults is required to prevent their escalation into major faults. The diagnostic tool for detection of faults requires real time monitoring of the entire drive. In this work, detailed investigation of different faults that can occur in the power electronic circuit of an industrial drive is carried out. Analysis and impact of faults on the performance of the induction motor is presented. A real time monitoring platform is proposed to detect and classify the fault accurately using machine learning.

The novel algorithm aims to avoid losing entries for missing factors by breaking the dataset into multiple subsets, building a different machine learning model for each subset, then combining the models into one machine learning model. In this manner, the model makes use of all available data and only neglects the missing values.

By non-compliant images, we mean images which do not have faces or there is not enough clarity in the faces present in the images uploaded. In this work, we attempt to address two specific problems namely: 1) To recognise image uploaded to recruitment portal contains a human face or not. This is addressed using a face detection algorithm. 2) To check whether images uploaded by two or more applications are same or not. This is achieved by using machine learning (ML) algorithms to generate similarity score between two images, and then identify the duplicate images.

Machine learning algorithms for fall detection using kinematic and heart rate parameters-a comprehensive analysis, 01 Dec 2020,"The application of machine learning techniques to detect and classify falls is a prominent area of research in the domain of intelligent assisted living systems. Machine learning (ML) based solutions for fall detection systems built on wearable devices use various sources of information such inertial motion units (IMU), vital signs, acoustic or channel state information parameters. Most existing research rely on only one of these sources; however, a need to do more experimenation to observe the efficiency of the ML classifiers while coupling features from diverse sources, was felt. In addition, fall detection systems based on wearable devices, require intelligent feature engineering and selection for dimensionality reduction, so as to reduce the computational complexity of the devices. In this paper we do a comprehensive performance analysis of ML classifiers for fall detection, on a dataset we collected. The analysis includes the impact of the following aspects on the performance of ML classifiers for fall detection: (i) using a combination of features from 2 sensors-an IMU sensor and a heart rate sensor, (ii) feature engineering and feature selection based on statistical methods, and (iii) using ensemble techniques for fall detection.

Enhancement of energy consumption estimation for electric vehicles by using machine learning, 01 Mar 2021,"Three main classes are considered of signiﬁcant inﬂuence factors when predicting the energy consumption rate of electric vehicles (EV): environment, driver behaviour, and vehicle. These classes take into account constant or variable parameters which inﬂuences the energy consumption of the EV.

The model depends on a new approach based on machine learning and especially k-NN algorithm in order to estimate the EV energy consumption. Following a lazy learning paradigm, this approach allows better estimation performance. The advantage of our proposal, in regards to mathematical approach, is taking into account the real situation of the ecosystem on the basis of historical data. In fact, the behavior of the driver (driving style, heating usage, air conditioner usage, battery state, etc.) impacts directly the EV energy consumption.

Using machine learning to predict the number of alternative solutions to a minimum cardinality set covering problem, 24 Feb 2021,"Although the characterization of alternative optimal solutions for linear programming problems is well known, such characterizations for combinatorial optimization problems are essentially non-existent. This is the first article to qualitatively predict the number of alternative optima for a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, namely, the minimum cardinality (also called unicost) set covering problem (MCSCP). For the MCSCP, a set must be covered by a minimum number of subsets selected from a specified collection of subsets of the given set. The MCSCP has numerous industrial applications that require that a secondary objective is optimized once the size of a minimum cover has been determined. To optimize the secondary objective, the number of MCSCP solutions is optimized. In this article, for the first time, a machine learning methodology is presented to generate categorical regression trees to predict, qualitatively (extra-small, small, medium, large, or extra-large), the number of solutions to an MCSCP. Within the machine learning toolbox of MATLABÂ®, 600,000 unique random MCSCPs were generated and used to construct regression trees. The prediction quality of these regression trees was tested on 5000 different MCSCPs. For the 5-output model, the average accuracy of being at most one off from the predicted category was 94.2%.Â ",International Journal of Industrial Optimization (IJIO),Universitas Ahmad Dahlan,"Emerick, Brooks","<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/80"">Decision Sciences, Operations Research &amp; Management </a>",http://journal2.uad.ac.id/index.php/ijio,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/8
Klasifikasi Jenis Pemeliharaan dan Perawatan Container Crane menggunakan Algoritma Machine Learning, 25 Mar 2021,"Pada industri jasa pelayanan peti kemas, Terminal Nilam merupakan pelanggan dari PT. BIMA, yang secara khusus bergerak dibidang jasa perbaikan dan perawatan alat berat. Terminal ini menjadi sentral tempat untuk melakukan aktifitas bongkar muat peti kemas domestik yang memiliki empat buah container crane untuk melayani dua kapal.

Uplift modeling VS conventional predictive model: A reliable machine learning model to solve employee turnover, 30 Jun 2021,"Employee turnover is the loss of talent in the workforce that can be costly for a company. Uplift modeling is one of the prescriptive methods in machine learning models that not only predict an outcome but also prescribe a solution. Recent studies are focusing on the conventional predictive models to predict employee turnover rather than uplift modeling. In this research, we analyze whether the uplifting model has better performance than the conventional predictive model in solving employee turnover. Performance comparison between the two methods was carried out by experimentation using two synthetic datasets and one real dataset. The results show that despite the conventional predictive model yields an average prediction accuracy of 84%; it only yields a success rate of 50% to target the right employee with a retention program on the three datasets.

Telemarketing dianggap lebih efektif dibandingkan dengan penggunaan baliho, flyer maupun brosur karena menghubungkan secara langsung antara perusahaan dengan calon pelanggan. Pada proses implementasinya, penggunaan telemarketing ini justru seringkali menemui kegagalan dan bahkan berujung pada sikap antipati calon pelanggan yang dihubungi bahkan sebelum proses komunikasi dilakukan. Salah satu penyebab terjadinya kegagalan dari proses telemarketing adalah tidak adanya proses seleksi untuk mengetahui potensi dari calon pelanggan. Machine learning menjadi salah satu alternatif yang dapat digunakan untuk membantu memilih dan menentukan calon pelanggan potensial dan sesuai dengan target perusahaan. Akan tetapi, missing values yang ada pada data telemarketing seringkali menjadi permasalahan baru yang harus ditangani agar penggunaan machine learning menjadi lebih efektif dan mendukung keberhasilah telemarketing. Pada penelitian ini, K-means digunakan sebagai salah satu cara untuk menangani adanya missing values pada data telemarketing. Hasilnya, terdapat peningkatan hingga sebesar 6% jika diukur berdasarkan nilai akurasi menggunakan model Decision Tree.

KLASIFIKASI DATA DELAY DENGAN LFID STRATEGI FORWARDING MENGGUNAKAN MACHINE LEARNING UNTUK MEMAKSIMALKAN KINERJA JARINGAN NDN (NAMED DATA NETWORK), 15 Dec 2020,"Named Data Network (NDN) is the future internet network that data-centric and adaptive to consumer requirement. Routing and forwarding systems on the NDN networks are different from IP networks due to the use of cache at each node on the network. The implementation of the Loop Free Inport-Dependent (LFID) routing protocol on NDN networks aims to eliminate loops on the network by eliminating the preferred routes or inefficient next hops. Forwarding strategies that can be implemented are Best Route, Access, Random, and Multicast. Therefore, machine learning technology is needed with various classification methods that can be implemented in machine learning so the output gives the recommendations that can be used to maximize the performance of the NDN network. The final result of this study recommends that the forwarding strategies of Best Route and Access provide good delay values, which in the range of 150 ms to 300 ms. Random forwarding strategy with a payload size> = 3072 kbps still provides a good delay value to the network, which in the 150 to 300 ms range.

An automatic screening approach for obstructive sleep apnea from photoplethysmograph using machine learning techniques, 01 Aug 2021,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a very common sleep disorder remains as an underdiagnosed root cause for several cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. In this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate system that utilizes a single sensor for effective screening of OSA using machine learning algorithms. The automatic screening system involves a photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal, a novel algorithm to detect and remove the corrupted part of the signal, a feature extraction module to extract several features from the PPG waveform and a classifier module which helps in screening for OSA. The elemental idea behind this work is that there is a characteristic relationship between the shape of the PPG waveform and the oxygen desaturation in the apnea patients. The method as described was tested on 285 subjects, inclusive of both normal and apnea patients, and the results were obtained after 10-fold-cross validation of the different machine learning techniques viz., univariate regression, multivariate regression, support vector machine and random forest. The best results in screening OSA were obtained from random forest algorithm with the highest performance (Acc:98.0%, Sen:98.6%, Spec:99.3%) for all the combined features.

Analisis Klasifikasi Sentimen Terhadap Sekolah Daring pada Twitter Menggunakan Supervised Machine Learning, 24 Apr 2021,"Covid-19 pandemic urges countries to limit interaction of their people to reduce transmission. Indonesia requires people to do activities at home, one of which is online school. Many people share their thoughts through social media Twitter. Therefore, authors conducted sentiment analysis using supervised machine learning algorithm to determine distribution of words used in commenting on online schools, relationship between sentence, length and sentiment, and best algorithms that can be used to get most accurate results. In this study, authors used the method of crawling with RapidMiner to get data from Twitter. Then authors do data cleansing, data processing with classification methods using Random Forest Classifier , Logistic Regression , BernoulliNB and SVC algorithm. After that authors evaluate using confusion matrix, accuracy rate and classification report. In this research, authors found there are positive, negative, and neutral sentiments expressed on the online school implementation through comments. Authors ranked top three most used words used to express positive sentiments which includes bahagia, rajin and senang. On negative sentiments, top three words are capek, muak and bosen. On neutral sentiments, top three words are tidur, capek, and buka. Lengthy Tweets are usually imbued with negative remarks. On the other hand, the tweet tends to be positive and neutral tweet is usually stable. Authors conclude that the weakness of online school is the amount of workload that makes students tired alongside ineffective teaching method which makes it hard for students to understand the material given by school. However, on the positive side, some people agree with policies that are implemented and they feel like they gained some benefits from the implementation. From the four supervised machine learning algorithms that have been tested, Logistic Regression shows the highest accuracy, 0,87.

PERANCANGAN PROSES IMPLEMENTASI MACHINE LEARNING DALAM MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT UNTUK MENCEGAH DERATING, 11 Jun 2021,Derating menjadi masalah yang sering kali muncul pada generator diesel di pembangkit listrik. Derating dapat menyebabkan penurunan kinerja dan produksi listrik pada generator. Kapasitas produksi listrik yang menurun nantinya akan menjadi masalah jika melihat kondisi konsumsi listrik nasional yang terus meningkat dari tahun ke tahun. Derating sering kali terjadi karena suhu yang tinggi pada charge air. Pencegahan derating dapat dilakukan dengan mengimplementasikan strategi maintenance yang mampu memprediksi derating dan mengakomodasi perubahan suhu charge air sebagai penyebab terjadinya derating. Penelitian ini akan memperlihatkan rancangan implementasi strategi maintenance berbasis data untuk memprediksi terjadinya derating dengan menggunakan pendekatan machine learning. Rancangan proses ini akan memberikan gambaran proses seperti apa yang dapat digunakan untuk mencegah derating sehingga membantu menjaga performa generator. Tahapan implementasi machine learning dilakukan dengan mengimpelementasikan proses knowledge discovery from data pada proses yang ada dalam maintenance management. Evaluasi terkait proses maintenance management dan machine learning menunjukkan bahwa machine learning dapat diimplementasikan pada tahap controlling. Klasifikasi kondisi generator juga didasarkan pada trend kondisi suhu charge air sehingga prediksi kondisi generator terkait derating tidak dipengaruhi oleh perubahan suhu yang bersifat cepat dan sementara. Penjabaran proses yang ada menunjukkan bahwa implementasi machine learning dalam maintenance management ini mungkin untuk dilakukan. Abstract[Designing The Implementation Process of Machine Learning in Maintenance Management to Avoid Derating] Derating is problem that often arises in power plant. Derating force generator to work below its optimum performance and resulting low production rate of electricity. Declining of electricity production capacity can be problem when we see condition of national electricity consumption in Indonesia which continues to increase year over year. Derating often occurs due to high temperatures in charge air. Derating prevention can be done by implementing maintenance strategy that is able to predict derating and accommodate changes in charge air temperature. This study designs processes of implementing data-based maintenance strategy to predict occurrence of derating using machine learning approach. Process design will provide overview of what kind of process can be used to avoid derating so that it helps maintain generator performance. Machine learning implementation can be done by implementing process of knowledge discovery from data in existing maintenance management process. Evaluations related to maintenance management and machine learning processes show that machine learning can be implemented at controlling stage. Classification of generator conditions is based on trend of charge air temperature so that prediction of generator conditions will not be affected by temporary changes in temperature. Process overview concludes that it is possible to implement machine learning in maintenance management.Keywords: decision tree; derating; machine learning; maintenance management,J@TI (TEKNIK INDUSTRI),Universitas Diponegoro,Bonifasius Yoga Adi Pratama,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/132"">Industrial &amp; Manufacturing Engineering</a>",https://ejournal.undip.ac.id/index.php/jgti,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/7

A Machine Learning Framework for Improving Classification Performance on Credit Approval, 30 Jun 2021,"Credit scoring is a model commonly used in the decision-making process to refuse or accept loan requests. The credit score model depends on the type of loan or credit and is complemented by various credit factors. At present, there is no accurate model for determining which creditors are eligible for loans. Therefore, an accurate and automatic model is needed to make it easier for banks to determine appropriate creditors. To address the problem, we propose a new approach using the combination of a machine learning algorithm (NaÃ¯ve Bayes), Information Gain (IG), and discretization in classifying creditors. This research work employed an experimental method using the Weka application. Australian Credit Approval data was used as a dataset, which contains 690 instances of data. In this study, Information Gain is employed as a feature selection to select relevant features so that the NaÃ¯ve Bayes algorithm can work optimally. The confusion matrix is used as an evaluator and 10-fold cross-validation as a validator. Based on experimental results, our proposed method could improve the classification performance, which reached the highest performance in average accuracy, precision, recall, and f-measure with the value of 86.29%, 86.33%, 86.29%, 86.30%, and 91.52%, respectively.

"MACHINE LEARNING APPLIED TO SENTINEL-2 AND LANDSAT-8 MULTISPECTRAL AND MEDIUM-RESOLUTION SATELLITE IMAGERY FOR THE DETECTION OF RICE PRODUCTION AREAS IN NGANJUK, EAST JAVA, INDONESIA", 07 Sep 2021,"Statistics Indonesia (BPS) has been introducing the use of Area Sampling Frame (ASF) surveys from 2018 to estimate rice production areas, although the process continues to suffer from the high costs of human and other resources. To support this type of conventional field survey, a more scalable and inexpensive approach using publicly-available remote sensing data, for example from the Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellites, has been explored. In this research, we compare the performance gain from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images using a multiple composite-index enriched machine learning classifier to detect rice production areas located in Nganjuk, East Java, Indonesia as a case study area. We build a detection model from a set of machine learning classifiers, Decision Tree (CART), Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Ensemble Bagging Methods (Random Forest and Extra Trees), and Ensemble Boosting Methods (AdaBoost and XGBoost). The composite indices consist of the NDVI and EVI for agricultural and forest areas, NDWI for water and cloud, and NDBI, NDTI, and BSI for built-up areas, fallows, and asphalt-based roads.

Optimized machine learning algorithm for intrusion detection, 01 Oct 2021,"Intrusion detection is mainly achieved by using optimization algorithms. The need for optimization algorithms for intrusion detection is necessitated by the increasing number of features in audit data, as well as the performance failure of the human-based smart intrusion detection system (IDS) in terms of their prolonged training time and classification accuracy. This article presents an improved intrusion detection technique for binary classification. The proposal is a combination of different optimizers, including Rao optimization algorithm, extreme learning machine (ELM), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR) (for feature selection & weighting), as well as a hybrid Rao-SVM algorithm with supervised machine learning (ML) techniques for feature subset selection (FSS). The process of selecting the least number of features without sacrificing the FSS accuracy was considered a multi-objective optimization problem. The algorithm-specific, parameter-less concept of the proposed Rao-SVM was also explored in this study. The KDDCup 99 and CICIDS 2017 were used as the intrusion dataset for the experiments, where significant improvements were noted with the new Rao-SVM compared to the other algorithms. Rao-SVM presented better results than many existing works by reaching 100% accuracy for KDDCup 99 dataset and 97% for CICIDS dataset.",Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,Royida A.

Support Directional Shifting Vector: A Direction Based Machine Learning Classifier, 01 Oct 2021,"Machine learning models have been very popular nowadays for providing rigorous solutions to complicated real-life problems. There are three main domains named supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement. Supervised learning mainly deals with regression and classification. There exist several types of classification algorithms, and these are based on various bases. The classification performance varies based on the dataset velocity and the algorithm selection. In this article, we have focused on developing a model of angular nature that performs supervised classification. Here, we have used two shifting vectors named Support Direction Vector (SDV) and Support Origin Vector (SOV) to form a linear function. These vectors form a linear function to measure cosine-angle with both the target class data and the non-target class data. Considering target data points, the linear function takes such a position that minimizes its angle with target class data and maximizes its angle with non-target class data. The positional error of the linear function has been modelled as a loss function which is iteratively optimized using the gradient descent algorithm. In order to justify the acceptability of this method, we have implemented this model on three different standard datasets.

Machine Learning Bias in Predicting High School Grades: A Knowledge Perspective, 01 Oct 2021,"This study focuses on the machine learning bias when predicting teacher grades. The experimental phase consists of predicting the student grades of 11th and 12thgrade Portuguese high school grades and computing the bias and variance decomposition. In the base implementation, only the academic achievement critical factors are considered. In the second implementation, the preceding year’s grade is appended as an input variable. The machine learning algorithms in use are random forest, support vector machine, and extreme boosting machine. The reasons behind the poor performance of the machine learning algorithms are either the input space poor preciseness or the lack of a sound record of student performance. We introduce the new concept of knowledge bias and a new predictive model classification. Precision education would reduce bias by providing low-bias intensive-knowledge models. To avoid bias, it is not necessary to add knowledge to the input space. Low-bias extensive-knowledge models are achievable simply by appending the student’s earlier performance record to the model. The low-bias intensive-knowledge learning models promoted by precision education are suited to designing new policies and actions toward academic attainments. If the aim is solely prediction, deciding for a low bias knowledge-extensive model can be appropriate and correct. Doi: 10.28991/esj-2021-01298 Full Text: PDF",Emerging Science Journal,Ital Publication,Ricardo Costa-Mendes,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/120"">Environmental Science</a>",http://ijournalse.org/index.php/ESJ,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/683

Performance Analysis of Weather Forecasting using Machine Learning Algorithms (Analisis Performansi Prakiraan Cuaca Menggunakan Algoritma Machine Learning), 31 Oct 2021,"Weather forecasting are very important in various fields of human life, including in big cities. The need for accurate weather forecasts will be effective and efficient in managing the quality of civilization flexibly. In many cases it is found that the results of weather forecasts in the same city differ depending on the radius. This of course requires a precise and accurate algorithm to determine it. The algorithm used is based on machine learning type of artificial neural network which compares backpropagation and bayessian regularization. The results obtained show that bayessian regularization outperforms backpropagation with the smallest MSE and the highest accuracy and the shortest computation time to determine sunny, cloudy, light rain and heavy rain forecasts. The unbalanced distribution of data causes fluctuations in the MSE calculation and accuracy. The addition of training will improve system performance which is indicated by a significant increase in accuracy. Likewise, decreasing the MSE can increase the accuracy of the system to reach the point of convergence.

"Pemetaan Daerah Rawan Longsor Menggunakan Machine Learning di Kecamatan Muara Tami, Kota Jayapura, Papua", 12 Oct 2021,"One of the high landslide vulnerability areas in Indonesia is located in Muara Tami District, Jayapura City. The main factors triggering the landslide are steep slopes and high elevations. However, there are still several other factors that also influence the occurrence of landslides, such as vegetation, land cover, and curvature. Landslides that occur can cause damages to all parties, both material and non-material. Therefore, it is necessary to map landslide-prone areas as a non-structural mitigation planning. This planning is useful for identifying areas that are relatively safer from landslides so that the fatalities incurred can be minimized. In this mapping, several parameters are used that are thought to trigger landslides, then they are calculated by machine learning using the random forest method. Based on the parameters used, the eastern and northwestern areas have high slope and elevation values, high curvature contrast values, and dry land forest cover. These results indicate the high potential for landslide vulnerability in both parts of the study area. Meanwhile, areas with low potential for landslide vulnerability have a curvature of 0, a relatively low slope and elevation. The model accuracy value obtained by the random forest method is 0.9. This value is categorized as good enough because it shows that the parameters used are good enough in mapping landslide vulnerability in the study area. These results are also supported by the high sensitivity and specificity values ​​based on the ROC curve. Areas with high potential for landslide vulnerability are Mosso Village and the border between Skow Mabo, Skow Yambe, Koya Tengah, Koya Timur, and Holtekam. Meanwhile, areas with low landslide potential were Skow Sae Village, the central part of East Koya, the northern part of West Koya, and the southern part of Holtekam.",Jurnal Geofisika,Himpunan Ahli Geofisika Indonesia,M Aldi,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/90"">Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences</a>",https://jurnal-geofisika.or.id/index.php/jurnal-geofisika,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/1617

Using machine learning to predict the number of alternative solutions to a minimum cardinality set covering problem, 24 Feb 2021,"Although the characterization of alternative optimal solutions for linear programming problems is well known, such characterizations for combinatorial optimization problems are essentially non-existent. This is the first article to qualitatively predict the number of alternative optima for a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, namely, the minimum cardinality (also called unicost) set covering problem (MCSCP). For the MCSCP, a set must be covered by a minimum number of subsets selected from a specified collection of subsets of the given set. The MCSCP has numerous industrial applications that require that a secondary objective is optimized once the size of a minimum cover has been determined. To optimize the secondary objective, the number of MCSCP solutions is optimized. In this article, for the first time, a machine learning methodology is presented to generate categorical regression trees to predict, qualitatively (extra-small, small, medium, large, or extra-large), the number of solutions to an MCSCP. Within the machine learning toolbox of MATLABÂ®, 600,000 unique random MCSCPs were generated and used to construct regression trees. The prediction quality of these regression trees was tested on 5000 different MCSCPs. For the 5-output model, the average accuracy of being at most one off from the predicted category was 94.2%.Â ",International Journal of Industrial Optimization (IJIO),Universitas Ahmad Dahlan,Brooks Emerick,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/80"">Decision Sciences, Operations Research &amp; Management </a>",http://journal2.uad.ac.id/index.php/ijio,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/8

Intelligent System of the Battle of Honor Board Game with Decision Making and Machine Learning. The Battle of Honor is a board game where 2 players face each other to bring down their opponent's flag. This game requires a third party to act as the referee because the players cannot see each other's pawns during the game. The solution to this is to implement Rule-Based Systems (RBS) on a system developed with Unity to support the referee's role in making decisions based on the rules of the game. Researchers also develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) as opposed to applying Case-Based reasoning (CBR). The application of CBR is supported by the nearest neighbor algorithm to find cases that have a high degree of similarity. In the basic test, the results of the CBR test were obtained with the highest formulated accuracy of the 3 examiners, namely 97.101%.

Performance Analysis of Weather Forecasting using Machine Learning Algorithms (Analisis Performansi Prakiraan Cuaca Menggunakan Algoritma Machine Learning), 31 Oct 2021,"Weather forecasting are very important in various fields of human life, including in big cities. The need for accurate weather forecasts will be effective and efficient in managing the quality of civilization flexibly. In many cases it is found that the results of weather forecasts in the same city differ depending on the radius. This of course requires a precise and accurate algorithm to determine it. The algorithm used is based on machine learning type of artificial neural network which compares backpropagation and bayessian regularization. The results obtained show that bayessian regularization outperforms backpropagation with the smallest MSE and the highest accuracy and the shortest computation time to determine sunny, cloudy, light rain and heavy rain forecasts. The unbalanced distribution of data causes fluctuations in the MSE calculation and accuracy. The addition of training will improve system performance which is indicated by a significant increase in accuracy. Likewise, decreasing the MSE can increase the accuracy of the system to reach the point of convergence.

A machine learning approach for the identification and classification of the schizophrenia disorder using EEG signals, 01 Dec 2021,"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that causes a person to hallucinate and lose touch of reality. The mental disorder is complex and difficult to assess, therefore, multiple tests are done to validate if a person has developed schizophrenia. Prolonged diagnosis may lead to debilitating effects on how a person thinks, feels or reacts. With this in mind, researchers are looking into the difference in brainwave patterns between schizophrenic and healthy patients. Brainwaves are measured using EEG electrodes which are placed across the surface of the head. EEG signals are known to fluctuate heavily when sensory receptors are stimulated. In one study, Roach et al. correlated the lack of N1 suppression in schizophrenic patients when exposed to auditory stimuli. The research aims to further the study of Roache et. Al by testing different machine learning algorithms and determining the model with the best accuracy and computational time. The paper utilizes the lack of N1 suppression to classify schizophrenic patients from healthy patients. Each patient is exposed to different conditions that prompt their auditory receptors. The following machine learning algorithms: support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision tree (DT) and DT-Adaboost were able to yield an accuracy above 90%.

Prediksi Harga Saham Menggunakan Metode Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) (Studi Kasus: Saham PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia), 23 Jun 2021,"Shares are a sign of ownership or membership of an entity or individual. The profit from the purchase of shares is derived from the acquisition of dividends and capital gains. The existence of stock trading in the secondary market, making the ups and downs of the share price so that there is a capital gain. A person who becomes a stock investor and takes advantage by selling shares he owns when the share price is higher than his previous purchase price is referred to as a trader. Due to fluctuations in the stock price, a trader needs analysis before making a stock purchase in order to avoid the risk of losses. In order to avoid losses of traders in the stock market, a stock price prediction system was created using the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) method.

Therefore, the significance of classifying network data streams to improve network system quality and security is attracting increasing study interests. This work introduces a machine learning-based approach to find the most suitable training model for network traffic classification tasks. Data pre-processing is first applied to normalize each feature type in the dataset. Different machine learning techniques, including k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Random Forest (RF), are applied based on the normalized features in the classification phase. An open-access dataset ISCXVPN2016 is applied for this research, which includes two types of encryption (VPN and Non-VPN) and seven classes of traffic categories classes. Experimental results on the open dataset have shown that the proposed models have reached a high classification rate – over 85% in some cases, in which the RF model obtains the most refined results among the three techniques.",Knowledge Engineering and Data Science,Universitas Negeri Malang,Kien Trang,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",http://journal2.um.ac.id/index.php/keds,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/16

Fast and accurate primary user detection with machine learning techniques for cognitive radio networks, 01 Jan 2021,"Spectrum decision is an important and crucial task for the secondary user to avail the unlicensed spectrum for transmission. Managing the spectrum is an efficient one for spectrum sensing. Determining the primary user presence in the spectrum is an essential work for using the licensed spectrum of primary user. The information which lacks in managing the spectrum are the information about the primary user presence, accuracy in determining the existence of user in the spectrum, the cost for computation and difficult in finding the user in low signal-to noise ratio (SNR) values. The proposed system overcomes the above limitations. In the proposed system, the various techniques of machine learning like decision tree, support vector machines, naive bayes, ensemble based trees, nearest neighbour’s and logistic regression are used for testing the algorithm. As a first step, the spectrum sensing is done in two stages with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing and Energy Detection algorithm at the various values of SNR. The results generated from the above algorithm is used for database generation. Next, the different machine learning techniques are trained and compared for the results produced by different algorithms with the characteristics like speed, time taken for training and accuracy in prediction. The accuracy and finding the presence of the user in the spectrum at low SNR values are achieved by all the algorithms. The computation cost of the algorithm differs from each other.

Efficient electro encephelogram classification system using support vector machine classifier and adaptive learning technique, 01 Jan 2022,"Complex modern signal processing is used to automate the analysis of electro encephelogram (EEG) signals. For the diagnosis of seizures, approaches that are simple and precise may be preferable rather than difficult and time-consuming. In this paper, efficient EEG classification system using support vector machine (SVM) and Adaptive learning technique is proposed. The database EEG signals are subjected to temporal and spatial filtering to remove unwanted noise and to increase the detection accuracy of the classifier by selecting the specific bands in which most of the EEG data are present. The neural network based SVM is used to classify the test EEG data with respect to training data. The cost-sensitive SVM with proposed Adaptive learning classifies the EEG signals where the adaptive learning with probability based function helps in prediction of the future samples and this leads in improving the accuracy with detection time. The detection accuracy of the proposed algorithm is compared with existing which shows that the proposed algorithm can classify the EEG signal more effectively.",Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,Virupaxi Balachandra Dalal,,http://ijeecs.iaescore.com/index.php/IJEECS,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6
Theme Identification using Machine Learning Techniques, 30 Nov 2021,"With the abundance of online research platforms, much information presented in PDF files, such as articles and journals, can be obtained easily. In this case, students completing research projects would have many downloaded PDF articles on their laptops. However, identifying the target articles manually within the collection can be tiring as most articles consist of several pages that need to be analyzed. Reading each article to determine if the article relates theme and organizing the articles based on themes is time and energy-consuming. Referring to this problem, a PDF files organizer that implemented a theme identifier is necessary. Thus, work will focus on automatic text classification using the machine learning methods to build a theme identifier employed in the PDF files organizer to classify articles into augmented reality and machine learning. A total of 1000 text documents for both themes were used to build the classification model. Moreover, the pre-preprocessing step for data cleaning and TF-IDF feature extraction for text vectorization and to reduce sparse vectors were performed. 80% of the dataset were used for training, and the remaining were used to validate the trained models.

This paper proposes a PdM model that utilizes machine learning to predict the system’s operational status after M active steps based on L previous observations implemented by a feedforward neural network (FFNN). We use quantization and encoding schemes to reduce the complexity of the system. We apply the proposed model to build a PdM system for wireless sensors networks (WSNs), where our concern is to predict the state of the system as far as the quality of data transfer is concerned. The FFNN provides a forward prediction of the operational status of the network after M consecutive time steps in the future, based on the previous L readings of quality of service (QoS) requirements of WSN. We also demonstrate the relation between complexity and accuracy. We found that larger M leads to higher complexity and larger prediction error, where larger L entails higher complexity and smaller prediction error.

Internet of things based electrocardiogram monitoring system using machine learning algorithm, 01 Aug 2022,"In Bangladesh’s rural regions, almost 30% of the population lives in poverty. Rural residents also have restricted access to nursing and diagnostic services due to obsolete healthcare infrastructure. Consequently, as cardiac failure occurs, they usually fail to call the services and adopt the facilities. The internet of things (IoT) offers a massive advantage in addressing cardiac problems. This study proposed a smart IoT-based electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring system for heart patients. The system is divided into several parts: ECG sensing network (data acquisition), IoT cloud (data transmission), result analysis (data prediction) and monetization. P, Q, R, S, and T are ECG signal properties fetched, pre-processed, analyzed and predicted to age level for future health management. ECG data are saved in the cloud and accessible via message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) and hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) servers. The linear regression method is utilized to determine the impact of electrocardiogram signal characteristics and error rate. The prediction was made to see how much variation there was in PQRST regularity and its sufficiency to be utilized in an ECG monitoring device. Recognizing the quality parameter values, acceptable outcomes are achieved. The proposed system will diminish future medical costs and difficulties for heart patients.",International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,Md.

Towards smart modeling of mechanical properties of a bio composite based on a machine learning, 01 Jun 2022,"The main interest in many research problems in polymer bio composites and machine learning (ML) is the development of predictive models to one or several variables of interest by the use of suitable independent inputs or variables. Nevertheless, these fields have generally adopted several approaches, while bio composite behavior modeling is usually based on phenomenological theories and physical models. These latter are more robust and precise, but they are generally under the restricted predictive ability due to the particular set of conditions. On the other hand, Machine learning models can be highly efficient in the modeling phase by allowing the management of high and massive dimensional sets of data to predict the best behavior of bio composites. In this situation, biomaterial scientists would like to benefit from the comprehension and implementation of the powerful ML models to characterize or predict the bio composites. In this study, we implement a smart methodology employing supervised neural network models to predict the bio composites properties presenting more significant environmental and economic advantages than composites reinforced by synthetic fibers.",International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,Aziz Moumen,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",http://ijece.iaescore.com/index.php/IJECE,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6

Linkage Detection of Features that Cause Stroke using Feyn Qlattice Machine Learning Model, 20 Dec 2021,"Stroke is a disease caused by brain tissue damage because of blockage in the cerebrovascular system that disrupts body sensory and motoric systems Stroke disease is one of the highest death cause in the world. Data collection from Electronic Health Records (EHR) is increasing and has been included in the health service big data. It can be processed and analyzed using machine learning to determine the risk group of stroke disease. Machine learning can be used as a predictor of stroke causes, while the predictor clarifies the influence of each cause factor of the disease. Our contribution in this research is to evaluate Feyn Qlattice machine learning models to detect the influence of stroke disease's main cause features. We attempt to obtain a correlation between features of the stroke disease, especially on the gender as a feature, whether any other features can influence the gender feature. This research utilizes 4908 data of the disease predictor using the Feyn Qlattice model. The result implies that gender highly impacts age and hypertension on stroke disease causes. Autorun in Feyn Qlattice model was run with ten epochs, resulting in 17596 test models at 57s. Query string parameter that was focused on age and hypertension features resulted in 1245 models at 4s. An increase of accuracy was found in training metrics from 0.723 to 0.732 and in testing metrics from 0.695 to 0.708.

Analisis Konsumsi Energi Listrik Pelanggan Dan Biaya Pokok Produksi Penyediaan Energi Listrik dengan Machine Learning, 30 Mar 2022,"PT PLN (Persero) during the Covid-19 pandemic was one of the companies whose sales growth was affected by the decline in electricity consumption in several sectors. Another condition is that several power plant and substation construction projects have fulfilled the realization commitment to the RUPTL from PT PLN (Persero). This has resulted in PT PLN (Persero) being faced with an over supply condition between power capacity and customer usage load. Realization of sales growth until July 2021 was 4.44% (144,788 TWh). Energy consumption in July 2021 was 20.55 TWh where the growth of kWh sales in July 2021 comparing with July 2020 began to show a recovery of +1.82%. The factor that most affected business and industrial growth was the manufacturing sector in Indonesia experiencing a slowdown/contraction as reflected in the PMI (Purchasing Managers Index) which decreased from 53.5 to 40.1. Growth is strongly influenced by consumer behavior in responding to government regulations, especially related to controlling the spread of Covid-19 in Indonesia in the form of restrictions on social activities (PSBB, PPKM, or Lockdown) which have been effectively implemented since April 2020 until now. Based on the analysis of the customer's electrical energy consumption data per industrial sector, as well as using technical data on the availability of power per electrical sub-system and the cost of producing electrical energy in an area, an evaluation model will be obtained that can be used in selecting the criteria for prospective customers who will be given program offers ""SEMAKIN PRODUKTIF"".

SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF INDONESIA’S DIGITAL WALLET USING COMBINATION MACHINE LEARNING AND EMOTICON WEIGHT, 20 Jan 2022,"Opinions on social media can be used to determine user sentiment by using sentiment analysis concept. Sentiment analysis requires several important stages, namely, preprocessing, feature extraction and classification method stages. The preprocessing stage was carried out to eliminate inconsistent data. In previous research, punctuation marks removal was applied at the preprocessing stage which can eliminate the emoticon position. Emoticons are a combination of punctuation marks. According to previous research, the emoticon feature has no contribution in sentiment analysis. There is another suggestion to maintain an emoticon position like converting an emoticon into a more relevant word such as :) into a “smile”. However, the feature of emoticon weights has not been considered in the sentiment analysis process. In order to consider the role of emoticons and to improve sentiment analysis performance, we propose using a combination of machine learning and emoticon weights. We perform emoticon weight based on probability and sentiment score. Each probability value and sentiment score of the emoticon will be normalized using the z-score method. There are several machine learning methods that have the best classification success rates, namely, Naïve Bayes and SVM. Based on the evaluation results of the proposed model, the best accuracy is 87% - 89% when using the combination of machine learning and emoticon sentiment score. Based on the results also show that the emoticon sentiment score has a significant effect on the accuracy of sentiment analysis.",Jurnal Ilmiah Teknologi dan Rekayasa,Universitas Gunadarma,"Tinambunan, Gusmariani","<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/30"">Automotive Engineering</a>",https://ejournal.gunadarma.ac.id/index.php/tekno,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/51

The way ML works are based on the process of data collection, training and output. ML is influenced by several factors, one of which is feature engineering. In this study, we focus on the literature review of several recent studies which show that the feature selection process greatly impacts the level of accuracy of this ML. Datasets such as KDD, UNSW-NB15 and others also affect the level of accuracy of ML. Based on this literature review, this study can observe several feature engineering strategies with relevant impacts that can be chosen to improve ML solutions on DDoS attacks.",JOURNAL OF INFORMATICS AND TELECOMMUNICATION ENGINEERING,Universitas Medan Area,Muhammad Nur Faiz,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",http://ojs.uma.ac.id/index.php/jite,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/627

Prediction of Hydraulic Fractured Well Performance Using Empirical Correlation and Machine Learning, 30 Aug 2021,"Hydraulic fracturing has been established as one of production enhancement methods in the petroleum industry. This method is proven to increase productivity and reserves in low permeability reservoirs, while in medium permeability, it accelerates production without affecting well reserves. However, production result looks scattered and appears to have no direct correlation to individual parameters. It also tend to have a decreasing trend, hence the success ratio needs to be increased. Hydraulic fracturing in the South Sumatra area has been implemented since 2002 and there is plenty of data that can be analyzed to resolve the relationship between actual production with reservoir parameters and fracturing treatment. Empirical correlation approach and machine learning (ML) methods are both used to evaluate this relationship. Concept of Darcy's equation is utilized as basis for the empirical correlation on the actual data. The ML method is then applied to provide better predictions both for production rate and water cut. This method has also been developed to solve data limitations so that the prediction method can be used for all wells. Empirical correlation can gives an R2Â of 0.67, while ML can gives a better R2Â that is close to 0.80. Furthermore, this prediction method can be used for well candidate selection means.",Scientific Contribution Oil and Gas,Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral,"Hamzah, Kamal","<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/40"">Chemical Engineering, Chemistry &amp; Bioengineering</a>",http://journal.lemigas.esdm.go.id/index.php/SCOG,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/450

Landslide Susceptibility Mapping using Machine Learning Algorithm, 01 Feb 2022,"Landslides are natural disasters that have resulted in the loss of economies and lives over the years. The landslides caused by the 2005 Muzaffarabad earthquake heavily impacted the area, and slopes in the region have become unstable. This research was carried out to find out which areas, as in Muzaffarabad district, are sensitive to landslides and to define the relationship between landslides and geo-environmental factors using three tree-based classifiers, namely, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). These machine learning models are innovative and can assess environmental problems and hazards for any given area on a regional scale. The research consists of three steps: Firstly, for training and validation, 94 historical landslides were randomly split into a proportion of 7/3. Secondly, topographical and geological data as well as satellite imagery were gathered, analyzed, and built into a spatial database using GIS Environment. Nine layers of landslide-conditioning factors were developed, including Aspect, Elevation, Slope, NDVI, Curvature, SPI, TWI, Lithology, and Landcover. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) value were used to estimate the model's efficiency. The area under the curve values for the RF, XGBoost, and KNN models are 0.895 (89.5%), 0.893 (89.3%), and 0.790 (79.0%), respectively. Based on the three machine learning techniques, the innovative outputs show that the performance of the Random Forest model has a maximum AUC value of 0.895, and it is more efficient than the other tree-based classifiers. Elevation and Slope were determined as the most important factors affecting landslides in this research area. The landslide susceptibility maps were classified into four classes: low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility. The result maps are useful for future generalized construction operations, such as selecting and conserving new urban and infrastructural areas. Doi: 10.28991/CEJ-2022-08-02-02 Full Text: PDF",Civil Engineering Journal,C.E.J Publishing Group,Muhammad Afaq Hussain,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/50"">Civil Engineering, Building, Construction &amp; Architecture</a>",http://civilejournal.org/index.php/cej,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/823

This was done following the same line of previous papers that proposed simulations of similar processes. A second component represents the role of memory, attention, and self-awareness in coping with the stressful event. Finally, the yoga practice, divided into physical movements and breathing, is modelled, to show its influence on memory, attention, and self-awareness, leading in this way to a reduction of the stress level.",Journal of Innovation and Technology,"Forum Teknik, BKS-PTN Wilayah Barat, Indonesia",Krishnamurthy Ramasubramanian,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/40"">Chemical Engineering, Chemistry &amp; Bioengineering</a>",https://ojs.umrah.ac.id/index.php/jit,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/2455
Systematic Review on Missing Data Imputation Techniques with Machine Learning Algorithms for Healthcare, 05 Feb 2022,"Missing data is one of the most common issues encountered in data cleaning process especially when dealing with medical dataset. A real collected dataset is prone to be incomplete, inconsistent, noisy and redundant due to potential reasons such as human errors, instrumental failures, and adverse death.

Predictive and probabilistic modelling using machine learning for building indoor climate control, 01 Jun 2022,"For the last few decades, thermal comfort has been considered an aspect of sustainable building evaluation methods and tools. However, estimating the indoor air temperature of buildings is a complicated task due to the nonlinear behaviour of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems combined with complex dynamics characterized by the time-varying environment with disturbances. This issue can be alleviated by modelling the building dynamics using Gaussian processes since it also measures the uncertainty bounds. The main focus of this paper is designing a predictive and probabilistic room temperature model of buildings using Gaussian processes and incorporating it into model predictive control to minimize energy consumption and provide thermal comfort satisfaction. We exploited the Gaussian processes’ full probabilistic capabilities as the mean prediction for the room temperature model and used the model uncertainty in the objective function not to lose the desired performance and to design a robust control scheme.

Optimized Multiple-Bit-Flip Soft-Errors-Tolerant TCAM using Machine Learning, 29 Mar 2022,"Soft errors from radiations can change the data in electronic devices especially memory cells such as in TCAMs. The soft errors cause bit-flip errors that makes the data are corrupted in the network. This paper presents a novel machine learning for a multiple-bit-flip-tolerant TCAM that address soft errors problem using partial don't-care keys (X-keys). The general methodology is classified into two steps, i.e., statistical training and X-keys matching. First, we train the machine by collecting match probability of a filter by using X-keys that match the same locations as the search key. This method uses statistical training to determine the most efficient of number of don't cares. Moreover, in the statistical training, we also explore the maximum number of don't cares that produce best performance in covering the soft errors. Finally, the X-keys are implemented in the TCAM to correct bit-flip errors. The suitable number of don't cares in X-key is determined from the distribution of match probability of the X-keys so that the best degree of tolerance of the TCAM against soft errors is found. Match probabilities for various filters are shown. Experimental results demonstrate that the soft-error tolerance using statistical data has better soft-error tolerance than other methods. The proposed method is useful for soft-error tolerant TCAMs in routers and firewalls for robust networks.",JURNAL NASIONAL TEKNIK ELEKTRO,Universitas Andalas,Infall Syafalni,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/100"">Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineering</a>",http://jnte.ft.unand.ac.id/index.php/jnte,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/66

In order to measure the effectiveness of detection and mitigation modules, several variables were examined, namely, accuracy, precision, recall, and the promptness of the flow mitigation installation process. The Honeypot server transmitted the flow rule modification message for blocking the attack using the Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface (REST API). The experiment results showed the effectiveness of CART algorithm for detecting and resolving the intrusion. Despite the accuracy score pointed at 69-70%, the algorithm could promptly deploy the mitigation flow within 31-49ms compared to the SVM, which produced 93-94% accuracy, but the flow installation required 112-305ms. The developed CART module can be considered a solution to prevent the attack effectively based on the analyzed variable.",JOIV : International Journal on Informatics Visualization,Politeknik Negeri Padang,Fauzi Dwi Setiawan Sumadi,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",http://joiv.org/index.php/joiv,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/89

Automatically Detect Software Security Vulnerabilities Based on Natural Language Processing Techniques and Machine Learning Algorithms, 11 May 2022,"Nowadays, software vulnerabilities pose a serious problem, because cyber-attackers often find ways to attack a system by exploiting software vulnerabilities. Detecting software vulnerabilities can be done using two main methods: i) signature-based detection, i.e. methods based on a list of known security vulnerabilities as a basis for contrasting and comparing; ii) behavior analysis-based detection using classification algorithms, i.e., methods based on analyzing the software code. In order to improve the ability to accurately detect software security vulnerabilities, this study proposes a new approach based on a technique of analyzing and standardizing software code and the random forest (RF) classification algorithm. The novelty and advantages of our proposed method are that to determine abnormal behavior of functions in the software, instead of trying to define behaviors of functions, this study uses the Word2vec natural language processing model to normalize and extract features of functions.

ROP Prediction with Supervised Machine Learning; a Case Study : Supervised Machine Learning, 08 Apr 2022,"Optimum drilling penetration rate, known as the rate of penetration (ROP) has played a big role in drilling operations. Planning the well ROP always becomes a challenge for drilling engineers to calculate the drilling time needed for the section. Optimum ROP is achieved when the time to drill the section is as planned. Many empirical approaches were develop to model the ROP based on the drilling parameters, and might not always match the actual ROP. In some cases, the actual ROP was slower than planned, which may increase the drilling cost, which needs to be avoided. Hence, some approaches using artificial intelligence (AI), and supervised machine learning have been develop to overcome it. Supervised machine learning is used to developed a ROP model and ROP prediction for one of the development fields, based only on two wells drilling parameters data. The model was trained using Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. Drilling parameter test data then is used to validate the model. The model of Random Forest shows a good or promising result with R2 of 0.90, Gradient Boosting shows R2 of 0.86, and Support Vector Machine with R2 0.72. Based on the models generated, the Random Forest has shown a good trend which could be used for modeling ROP in the future development wells",JOURNAL OF EARTH ENERGY ENGINEERING,Universitas Islam Riau,Ganesha R Darmawan,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/90"">Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences</a>",http://journal.uir.ac.id/index.php/JEEE,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/438

INOVASI TEKNOLOGI MACHINE LEARNING BAGI MASYARAKAT DI EKOWISATA SUNGKAI GREEN PARK NAGARI LAMBUNG BUKIT KECAMATAN PAUH PADANG, 31 Mar 2022,"Most of the people who live in urban areas have an increasing need for food. One of the activities that can utilize land and resources in urban areas is urban farming. One example is the Sungkai Green Park Ecotourism in Nagari Lambung Bukit, Pauh Padang District, which has various types of plants that are very useful. However, due to the many and varied plants, farmers experience difficulties in terms of plant maintenance. Therefore, this journal aims to classify weeds and plants, in order to facilitate farmers in plant care. The method that will be applied uses machine learning with image processing to separate weeds and plants which can reduce manual work visually. Image analysis accurately detects areas of identified weeds. Each image has a different pattern and spatial distribution and can be detected using the GLCM technique. This technique represents the relationship between two conflicting pixels in the image. Overall, the image is taken using a webcam which is positioned vertically against the sample plant at low brightness conditions so that it can be processed accurately in machine learning. This GLCM feature is able to extract images to separate weeds and plants by using a texture matrix from the image. The output of the matrix in the form of parameters mean, skewness, kurtosis, entropy, contrast, and energy. These parameters are used to obtain a value for plants so that weeds can be distinguished from plants.

An Empirical Evaluation On Comparative Machine Learning Techniques For Detection of The Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks, 17 May 2020,"The advent of the Internet that aided the efficient sharing of resources. Also, it has introduced adversaries whom are today restlessly in their continued efforts at an effective, non-detectable means to invade secure systems, either for fun or personal gains. They achieve these feats via the use of malware, which is both on the rise, wreaks havoc alongside causing loads of financial losses to users. With the upsurge to counter these escapades, users and businesses today seek means to detect these evolving behavior and pattern by these adversaries. It is also to worthy of note that adversaries have also evolved, changing their own structure to make signature detection somewhat unreliable and anomaly detection tedious to network administrators. Our study investigates the detection of the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks using machine learning techniques. Results shows that though evolutionary models have been successfully implemented in the detection DDoS, the search for optima is an inconclusive and continuous task. That no one method yields a better optima than hybrids. That with hybrids, users must adequately resolve the issues of data conflicts arising from the dataset to be used, conflict from the adapted statistical methods arising from data encoding, and conflicts in parameter selection to avoid model overtraining, over-fitting and over-parameterization.","Journal of Applied Science, Engineering, Technology, and Education",Yayasan Ahmar Cendekia Indonesia,Arnold Ojugo,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/50"">Civil Engineering, Building, Construction &amp; Architecture</a>",http://jurnal.ahmar.id/index.php/asci,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/1903

"Associated Patterns and Predicting Model of Life Trauma, Depression, and Suicide Using Ensemble Machine Learning", 29 May 2022,"This study aimed to find associated patterns by association rule mining and propose a prediction model using ensemble learning methods of high levels of trauma items affecting depression and suicide among primary school students in Thai rural extended opportunity schools. Our proposed methods were different from others that have analysed the relationship of high life trauma leading to depression and suicide by using statistical analysis. We found strongly associated patterns and effects among primary students’ trauma, depression, and suicide. The trauma of psychological abuse and neglect may result in suicide, whereas psychological abuse, neglect, and the experience of self-harm are also likely to result in the increased severity of traumatic events in life. The trauma of physical and sexual abuse, neglect, helplessness, feeling worthless, being weak, and self-harm were associated with depression. Our research discovered new knowledge that the risk of suicide arises from two extreme types of trauma: when children’s safety is frequently threatened and the family communicates frequently using rude or abusive words; these traumas may not merely correlate with depression but may ultimately result in suicide. Moreover, this study discovered 7 highly important trauma items and 4 suicide items for predicting depression and suicide using the Random Forest technique. We found that the Random Forest technique performed well in predicting depression and suicide. The predicted depression results show that the overall accuracy was 85.84%, precision was 89.33%, and recall was 75.28%. The predicted suicide results show that the overall accuracy was 91.28%, precision was 89.05%, and recall was 84.72%. From these results, we identified high life trauma affecting depression and suicide, which are very beneficial to practitioners to use in preliminary screening.

Hasil dari pengujian sistem terhadap dua subjek user didapatkan konfigurasi user1 (sistem akan menyala dari jam 12:21:37 hingga jam 17:53:18 dengan rata-rata konsumsi daya dalam satu hari adalah 165.61 Watt), user2 (sistem akan menyala dari jam 21:29:55 hingga jam 08:41:31, akan menyala lagi dari jam 17:40:13 hingga jam 18:14:51 dengan rata-rata konsumsi daya dalam satu hari adalah 543.14 Watt).",SinarFe7,Forum Pendidikan Tinggi Teknik Elektro Indonesia Regional Jawa Timur,Muhammad Furqon,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",https://journal.fortei7.org/index.php/sinarFe7,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/3051
Analisis Komparatif Algoritme Machine Learning dan Penanganan Imbalanced Data pada Klasifikasi Kualitas Air Layak Minum, 21 Apr 2022,"Abstract. Water is essential for survival. Currently, there are requirements to monitor, assess, and classify water quality to understand the impact of industrialization. The water quality classification process has been carried out using traditional methods such as WQI and Storet, and machine learning methods. Imbalanced data in machine learning method can make this method have a tendency to predict the majority class and become biased. In addition, using all features in the classification process can degrade classification performance and lead to high computation time. To overcome the above-mentioned problems, this study proposes several approaches, included resampling the data to be balanced, determined the most suitable and contributing features, and compared the performance of machine learning algorithms in classifying potable water. The results of handling unbalanced data and implementing feature selection were able to provide increased work on the algorithm, especially the accuracy metric reached 24.8% from previous study. The most optimal algorithm performance was obtained from Random Forest with 87% of precision, 84% of recall, 16% of Miss rate, 85% of F-measure, and 85% of test accuracy, while used seven best features. However, another important aspect is the smallest Miss rate, which was 15%, obtained from Decision Tree algorithm.",Konstelasi: Konvergensi Teknologi dan Sistem Informasi,Universitas Atma Jaya Yogyakarta,Generosa Lukhayu Pritalia,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",https://ojs.uajy.ac.id/index.php/konstelasi,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/163
Sentiment analysis on Bangla conversation using machine learning approach, 01 Oct 2022,"Nowadays, online communication is more convenient and popular than face-to-face conversation. Therefore, people prefer online communication over face-to-face meetings. Enormous people use online chatting systems to speak with their loved ones at any given time throughout the world. People create massive quantities of conversation every second because of their online engagement. People's feelings during the conversation period can be gleaned as useful information from these conversations. Text analysis and conclusion of any material as summarization can be done using sentiment analysis by natural language processing. The use of communication for customer service portals in various e-commerce platforms and crime investigations based on digital evidence is increasing the need for sentiment analysis of a conversation. Other languages, such as English, have well-developed libraries and resources for natural language processing, yet there are few studies conducted on Bangla. It is more challenging to extract sentiments from Bangla conversational data due to the language's grammatical complexity. As a result, it opens vast study opportunities. So, support vector machine, multinomial naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest was used.

Modified SEIR and machine learning prediction of the trend of the epidemic of COVID-19 in Jordan under lockdowns impact, 01 Oct 2022,"Susceptible exposed infectious recovered (SEIR) is a fitting model for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread prediction. Hence, to examine the effect of different levels of social distancing on the spreading of the disease, a variable was introduced in the SEIR equations system used in this work. We also used an artificial intelligence approach using a machine learning (ML) method known as deep neural network. This modified SEIR model was applied on the available initial spread data until June 25th, 2021 for the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Without lockdown in Jordan, the analysis demonstrates potential infection to roughly 3.1 million people during the peak of spread approximately 3 months, starting from the date of lockdown (March 21st). Conversely, the present partial lockdowns strategy by the Kingdom was expected to reduce the predicted number of infections to 0.5 million in 9 months period. The analysis also demonstrates the ability of stricter lockdowns to effectively flatten the graph curve of COVID-19 in Jordan. Our modified SEIR and deep neural network (DNN) model were efficient in the prediction of COVID-19 epidemic sizes and peaks. The measures taken to control the epidemic by the government decreased the size of the COVID-19 epidemic.",International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,Mutasem Khalil Alsmadi,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",http://ijece.iaescore.com/index.php/IJECE,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6
Application of machine learning in cement price prediction through a web-based system, 01 Oct 2022,"Cement is one of the most common building materials in the construction industry. Simultaneously, its price fluctuation can affect the success or failure of the construction project's performance. The study aimed to develop a web-based platform that uses machine learning algorithms on historical data of cement prices, petrol prices, diesel prices, interest rate, and exchange rate to predict future prices of cement products. The web-based learning platform was developed using hypertext markup language (HTML), cascading style sheet (CSS), MySQL, and hypertext preprocessor (PHP).

Weather prediction performance evaluation on selected machine learning algorithms, 01 Dec 2022,"Prediction of weather has been proved useful in the early warning on the impacts of weather on several areas of human livelihood. For example, the provision of decisions for autonomous transportation to reduce traffic congestion and accidents during the rainy season. However, providing the most accurate and effective forecasting model for weather forecasts has been a challenge. Hence, machine learning (ML) techniques and factors influencing weather prediction need to be investigated. Data scientists are yet to discover the best models for weather prediction. Therefore, this study compares three ML classification techniques for weather prediction.

Hardware sales forecasting using clustering and machine learning approach, 01 Sep 2022,"This research is a case study of an information technology (IT) solution company. There is a problem that is quite crucial in the hardware sales strategy which makes it difficult for the company to predict the number of various items that will be sold and also causes the excess or shortage in hardware stocking. This research focuses on clustering to group various of items and forecast the number of items in each cluster using a machine learning approach. The methods used in clustering are k-means clustering, agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC), and gaussian mixture models (GMM), and the methods used in forecasting are autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and recurrent neural network-long short-term memory (RNN-LSTM). For clustering, k-means uses two attributes, namely ""Quantity and Stock"" as the best feature in this case study. Using these features the k-means obtain silhouette results of 0.91 and davies bouldin index (DBI) values of 0.34 consisting of 3 clusters. While for forecasting, RNN-LSTM is the best method, where it produces more cost savings than the ARIMA method. The percentage of the difference in saving costs between ARIMA and RNN-LSTM to the actual cost is 83%.",IAES International Journal of Artificial Intelligence (IJ-AI),Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,Rani Puspita,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",http://ijai.iaescore.com/index.php/IJAI,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6
Machine learning model for green building design prediction, 01 Dec 2022,"Green Building (GB) is a design concept that implements sustainable processes and green technologies in the building’s life cycle. However, the design process of GB tends to take longer than conventional buildings due to the integration of various green requirements and performances into the building design. Technological advances are continually improving the quality of human life by providing solutions to problems they encounter, such as the machine learning (ML) technique utilized to develop predictive and classification models. This study aims to develop a GB design prediction by employing an ML approach by considering four GB design criteria: energy efficiency, indoor environmental quality, water efficiency, and site planning. A dataset of GB projects collected from a private construction company based in Jakarta was used to train and test the ML model. Mean Square Error (MSE) was used to evaluate the model accuracy. The comparison of MSE results of the conducted experiments showed that the combination of the ANN method with the IF-ELSE algorithm resulted in the most accurate ML model for GB design prediction with an MSE of 1.3, creating a predictive model that improves the time efficiency of GB design process.",IAES International Journal of Artificial Intelligence (IJ-AI),Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,Mustika Sari,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",http://ijai.iaescore.com/index.php/IJAI,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6
Machine learning based chroma phase offset detection and correction in motion video, 01 Dec 2022,"Generally, chroma phase or hue offset issues within a scene are hard to detect, without a reference or context (i.e. some apriori knowledge about how certain objects within the scene should actually appear in terms of their hue). Moreover, when it comes to skin/flesh tones, hue deviation can be noticeable and can markedly degrade the viewer quality of experience(QoE), whenever it does occur. However a lot of research has gone into flesh tone detection, specifically, the color gamut within which flesh tone is present. This topic has been well documented in the literature with respect to various color spaces: red, green, blue (RGB) and YIQ. Therefore, overall issues with chroma offset or hue within the video content could potentially be approached by extracting and analyzing a reliable reference, such as skin or flesh tone (if present), within some allowable deviation. This involves machine learning (ML) based facial recognition and tracking followed by skin tone region recognition within the detected facial sequence (i.e. Region of Interest). The skin region serves as a ‘self-reference’ in order to discern any inherent phase offset within the content. Finally, the angular chroma deviation discerned can then be used for subsequent correction as well. ",IAES International Journal of Artificial Intelligence (IJ-AI),Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,Advait Mogre,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",http://ijai.iaescore.com/index.php/IJAI,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6
Machine learning of tax avoidance detection based on hybrid metaheuristics algorithms, 01 Sep 2022,"This paper addresses the performances of machine learning classification models for the detection of tax avoidance problems. The machine learning models employed automated features selection with hybrid two metaheuristics algorithms namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA). Dealing with a real dataset on the tax avoidance cases among companies in Malaysia, has created a stumbling block for the conventional machine learning models to achieve higher accuracy in the detection process as the associations among all of the features in the datasets are extremely low. This paper presents a hybrid meta-heuristic between PSO and adaptive GA operators for the optimization of features selection in the machine learning models. The hybrid PSO-GA has been designed to employ three adaptive GA operators hence three groups of features selection will be generated. The three groups of features selection were used in random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and support vector machine (SVM). The results showed that most models that used PSO-GA hybrids have achieved better accuracy than the conventional approach (using all features from the dataset).

Data Fairness Transmission and Adaptive Duty Cycle through Machine Learning in wireless Sensor Networks, 30 Jun 2022,"In this paper, we propose the data fairness transmission and adaptive duty cycle through machine learning in wireless sensor networks. The mechanism of this paper is mainly composed of two parts. The proposed mechanism is based on the sleep-wake structure, which is one of the methods to increase the lifespan of the entire network by efficiently using the energy of the nodes. The first is a mechanism to support priority and data fairness. To this end, data input to the node is divided into priority classes according to transmission urgency and stored. Introduces the concept of cross-layer to rearrange data destined for the same destination. In addition, we propose a fair data transmission mechanism that allows even low-priority data to participate in transmission after a certain period. The second is an adaptive duty cycle mechanism through machine learning. For this purpose, public data related to forest fires are collected. The collected data is refined into data for each forest fire location and data for each forest fire time. For the refined data, an SVM (Support Vector Machine) model of supervised learning is used for machine learning, and a mechanism for adaptively adjusting the duty cycle of each node through the trained model is proposed. The computer language used for machine learning is Python language, and Google's Psychic Learn is used for the machine learning library.

An Intrusion Detection System Using SDAE to Enhance Dimensional Reduction in Machine Learning, 30 Jun 2022,"In the last decade, the number of attacks on the internet has grown significantly, and the types of attacks vary widely. This causes huge financial losses in various institutions such as the private and government sectors. One of the efforts to deal with this problem is by early detection of attacks, often called IDS (instruction detection system). The intrusion detection system was deactivated. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a hardware or software mechanism that monitors the Internet for malicious attacks. It can scan the internetwork for potentially dangerous behavior or security threats. IDS is responsible for maintaining network activity under the Network-Based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) or Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS). IDS works by comparing known normal network activity signatures with attack activity signatures. In this research, a dimensional reduction and feature selection mechanism called Stack Denoising Auto Encoder (SDAE) succeeded in increasing the effectiveness of Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, and SVM. The researchers evaluated the performance using evaluation metrics with a confusion matrix, accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Compared with the results of previous works in the IDS field, our model increased the effectiveness to more than 2% in NSL-KDD Dataset, including in binary class and multi-class evaluation methods. Moreover, using SDAE also improved traditional machine learning with modern deep learning such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In the future, it is possible to integrate SDAE with a deep learning model to enhance the effectiveness of IDS detection",JOIV : International Journal on Informatics Visualization,Politeknik Negeri Padang,Hanafi Hanafi,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",http://joiv.org/index.php/joiv,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/89
Machine Translation in Website Localization: Assessing its Translation Quality for Language Learning, 09 Jun 2022,"This study seeks to investigate the quality of translation generated by a popular Machine Translation (MT) platform, viz. Google Translate (GT) in translating the content of a Russian flight charterer’s website from English into Indonesian. To analyze the translation quality produced by MT, we compared the original translation of the website texts translated by a human translator and the machine-translated version. The translation quality is limited to the readability level. The texts serving as the data were collected from the menus of a Russian flight chartering service website which was originally translated by an Indonesian translator. An analysis further discovered that the translation produced by MT is divided into two quality categories: less readable and readable. The less readable translation is caused by MT’s inability to adjust to stylistic forms in Indonesian, failure to do adaptation strategy and in some cases, MT tends to follow the same sentence structure of the original text (source text).  ",AL-ISHLAH: Jurnal Pendidikan,STAI Hubbulwathan Duri,Dewi Kesuma Nasution,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/97"">Education</a>",https://journal.staihubbulwathan.id/index.php/alishlah,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/523

Comparing Five Machine Learning-Based Regression Models for Predicting the Study Period of Mathematics Students at IPB University, 16 Jul 2022,"Grade point average (GPA) is initial information for supervisors to characterize their supervised students. One model that can be used to predict a student's study period based on GPA is a machine learning-based regression model so that supervisors can apply the right strategy for their students. Therefore, this study aims to implement and select a machine learning-based regression model to predict a student's study period based on GPA in semesters 1-6. Several regression models used are least-square regression, ridge regression, Huber regression, quantile regression, and quantile regression with l_2-regularization provided by Machine Learning in Julia (MLJ). The model is evaluated and selected based on several criteria such as maximum error, RMSE, and MAPE. The results showed that the least-square regression model gave the worst evaluation results, although the calculation method was easy and fast. Meanwhile, the quantile regression model provided the best evaluation results. The quantile regression model without regularization gives the smallest RMSE (2.31 months) and MAPE (3.56%), while the quantile regression model with l_2-regularization has a better maximum error (4.9 months). The resulting model can be used by supervisors to predict the study period of their supervised students so that supervisors can characterize their students and can design appropriate strategies.

Machine Learning Used Car Price Prediction with Random Forest Regressor Model, 02 Jun 2022,"The pandemic has stopped all activities, including the decline in the level of the world economy, this will reduce people's purchasing power. For those who want to buy a car, a used car can be the second option. In some used car sales showrooms, the main task is to determine price predictions based on historical data during previous transactions. The determinants of car prices are heavily influenced by several attributes in the car, for example: type of fuel, for example, km traveled and so on, this is what causes the price prediction process to take a long time. One of the roles in Macine Learning is being able to learn from previous transaction data and this will be a model that can be used to provide used car price predictions. Car price prediction is included in regression, which is looking for a strong relationship from the influence of variable X (predictor) to variable Y (target). In the prediction, of course, the reality data will not be right with the predicted data, for that in the measurement the model will look for the lowest error rate. The experimental results on the test data using the Random Forest Regressor model resulted in MAE = 1.006 and RMSE = 1.452 while the coefficient of determinant R2 = 0.89. And in the previous study with KNN [18], it produced an error rate of MAE = 2.01 and RMSE = 4.01 and the coefficient of determinant R2 = 0.85. While the comparison model uses Linear Regression, Ridge, Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting. Not all Machine Learning models are suitable for all data, for that it is necessary to choose the right machine learning model by experimenting with several models. And the lowest error level (MAE and RMSE) will be determined. The error values ​​for MAE and RMSE which are close to zero are close to the predicted value close to the actual value. On the other hand, if the error rate is very high, the prediction value is very far from the actual value.","JISICOM (Journal of Information System, Infomatics and Computing)",Sekolah Tinggi Manajemen Informatika dan Komputer Jayakarta,Bambang Kriswantara,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",http://journal.stmikjayakarta.ac.id/index.php/jisicom,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/1345

Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based floor detection using adaptive scaling and weighted autoencoder extreme learning machine, 01 Jul 2022,"In practical applications, accurate floor determination in multi-building/floor environments is particularly useful and plays an increasingly crucial role in the performance of location-based services. An accurate and robust building and floor detection can reduce the location search space and ameliorate the positioning and wayfinding accuracy. As an efficient solution, this paper proposes a floor identification method that exploits statistical properties of wireless access point propagated signals to exponent received signal strength (RSS) in the radio map. Then, using single-layer extreme learning machine-weighted autoencoder (ELM-WAE) main feature extraction and dimensional reduction is implemented. Finally, ELM based classifier is trained over a new feature space to determine floor level. For the efficiency evaluation of our proposed model, we utilized three different datasets captured in the real scenarios. The evaluation result shows that the proposed model can achieve state-of-art performance and improve the accuracy of floor detection compared with multiple recent techniques. In this way, the floor level can be identified with 97.30%, 95.32%, and 96.39% on UJIIndoorLoc, Tampere, and UTSIndoorLoc datasets, respectively.",Computer Science and Information Technologies,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,Atefe Alitalesi,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>",http://iaesprime.com/index.php/csit,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6
