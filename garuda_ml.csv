Software Defect Prediction Using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique and Extreme Learning Machine,Article InfoPublish Date 20 Feb 2020,"Software testing is one of the crucial processes in software development life cycle which will influence the software quality. One of the strategies to help testing process is predicting the part or module of software which is prone to defect. Then, the testing process can be more focused to those parts. In this research a classifier model for predicting software defect was built. One of the most important problems in software defect prediction is imbalance data distribution between samples of positive class (prone to defect) and of negative class. Therefore, in this research SMOTE is implemented to handle imbalance data problem and extreme learning machine is implemented as a classification algorithm. As a comparison to SMOTE-ELM, a modification of ELM which directly copes with imbalance problem, weighted-ELM, is also observed. This research used NASA MDP dataset PC1, PC2, PC3 and PC4. The results of experiment using 10-fold cross validation show that directly classification using ELM obtain the worse result compared to SMOTE-ELM and weighted-ELM. When the value of imbalance ratio is not very small, the SMOTE-ELM is better than weighted-ELM. When the value of imbalance ratio is very small, the g-mean of weighted-ELM is higher than the g-mean of SMOTE-ELM, but the accuracy of weighted-ELM is lower than the accuracy of SMOTE-ELM. Therefore, in this software defect prediction case it can be concluded that SMOTE is effective to increase the generalization performance of classifier in minority class as long as the value of imbalance ratio is not very small.",Journal of Telematics and Informatics,http://section.iaesonline.com/index.php/JTI,IAES Indonesia Section and Partners,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/65,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"

Prediction of 4f7-4f65d1 transition energy of Eu2+ in oxides based on first-principles calculations and machine learning,Article InfoPublish Date 09 Apr 2020,"In order to establish a method to predict the 4f7-4f65d1 transition energy of Eu2+ in oxides, linear regression models were created based on first-principles calculations and machine learning. The model clusters consisting of the central Eu2+ and O2- ions closer than the nearest cation were constructed and the 4f7-4f65d1 absorption energy of Eu2+ in these clusters were calculated by first-principles many-electron calculation using the relativistic discrete variational multi-electron (DVME) method. However, the 4f7-4f65d1 absorption energies of Eu2+ in oxides calculated by relatively simple first-principles calculations tend to be overestimated by ca. 1.6 eV. In order to improve the accuracy of the prediction, we performed machine learning considering the calculated absorption energy as well as the other electronic and structural parameters as the attributes. As a result, the regression formula to predict the 4f7-4f65d1 absorption energy of Eu2+ in oxides has been created by machine learning. The 4f7-4f65d1 absorption energy predicted by this model are in good agreement with the experimental ones. Therefore, accuracy of the prediction was significantly improved compared to the simple first-principles calculations.

Face recognition can provide the most natural interaction experience similar to the way humans can recognize others. This paper presents a performance comparison of various machine learning approaches and feature extraction algorithms. The feature extraction algorithm used is Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and a combination of PCA-LDA. The method used is to take a dataset sample and then evaluate and compare machine learning algorithms to analyze accuracy in recognizing faces. We also use feature extraction techniques on facial image capture to speed up data processing. The classification algorithms measured are k-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, support vector machine, random forest, and gradient boosting. The results showed that the random forest classification algorithm was the most accurate face recognition method.

Prediction of Solar Radiation Intensity using Extreme Learning Machine,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Nov 2018,"The generated energy capacity at a solar power plant depends on the availability of solar radiation. In some regions, solar radiation is not always available throughout the day, or even week, depending on the weather and climate in the area. To be able to produce energy optimally throughout the year, the availability of solar radiation needs to be predicted based on the weather and climate behavior data. Many methods have been so far used to predict the availability of solar radiation, either by mathematical approach, statistical probability, or even artificial intelligence-based methods. This paper describes a method of predicting the availability of solar radiation using the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) method. It is based on the artificial intelligence methods and known to have a good prediction accuracy. To measure the performance of the ELM method, a conventional forecasting method using the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) method has been used as a comparison. The implementation of both the ELM and MLR methods has been tested using the solar radiation data of the Basel City, Switzerland, which are available to public. Five years of data have been divided into training data and testing data for 6 case-studies considered. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) have been used as the parameters to measure the prediction results based on the actual data analysis. The results show that the obtained average values of RMSE and MAE by using the ELM method respectively are 122.45 W/m2 and 84.04 W/m2, while using the MLR method they are 141.18 W/m2 and 104.87 W/m2 respectively. It means that the ELM method proved to perform better than the MLR method, giving 15.29% better value of RMSE parameter and 24.79% better value of MAE parameter.",Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,http://ijeecs.iaescore.com/index.php/IJEECS,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6,

Image processing and machine learning techniques used in computer-aided detection system for mammogram screening - a review,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Jun 2020,"This paper aims to review the previously developed Computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for mammogram screening because increasing death rate in women due to breast cancer is a global medical issue and it can be controlled only by early detection with regular screening. Till now mammography is the widely used breast imaging modality. CAD systems have been adopted by the radiologists to increase the accuracy of the breast cancer diagnosis by avoiding human errors and experience related issues. This study reveals that in spite of the higher accuracy obtained by the earlier proposed CAD systems for breast cancer diagnosis, they are not fully automated. Moreover, the false-positive mammogram screening cases are high in number and over-diagnosis of breast cancer exposes a patient towards harmful overtreatment for which a huge amount of money is being wasted. In addition, it is also reported that the mammogram screening result with and without CAD systems does not have noticeable difference, whereas the undetected cancer cases by CAD system are increasing. Thus, future research is required to improve the performance of CAD system for mammogram screening and make it completely automated.",International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering,http://ijece.iaescore.com/index.php/IJECE,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"
The classification of the modern arabic poetry using machine learning,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Oct 2019,"In recent years, working on text classification and analysis of Arabic texts using machine learning has seen some progress, but most of this research has not focused on Arabic poetry. Because of some difficulties in the analysis of Arabic poetry, it was required the use of standard Arabic language on which “Al Arud”, the science of studying poetry is based. This paper presents an approach that uses machine learning for the classification of modern Arabic poetry into four types: love poems, Islamic poems, social poems, and political poems. Each of these species usually has features that indicate the class of the poem. Despite the challenges generated by the difficulty of the rules of the Arabic language on which this classification depends, we proposed a new automatic way of modern Arabic poems classification to solve these issues. The recommended method is suitable for the above-mentioned classes of poems. This study used Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Linear Support Vector for the classification processes.

A technical review and comparative analysis of machine learning techniques for intrusion detection systems in MANET,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Jun 2020,"Machine learning techniques are being widely used to develop an intrusion detection system (IDS) for detecting and classifying cyber attacks at the network-level and the host-level in a timely and automatic manner. However, Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), based on traditional machine learning methods, lacks reliability and accuracy. Instead of the traditional machine learning used in previous researches, we think deep learning has the potential to perform better in extracting features of massive data considering the massive cyber traffic in real life. Generally Mobile Ad Hoc Networks have given the low physical security for mobile devices, because of the properties such as node mobility, lack of centralized management and limited bandwidth. To tackle these security issues, traditional cryptography schemes can-not completely safeguard MANETs in terms of novel threats and vulnerabilities, thus by applying Deep learning methods techniques in IDS are capable of adapting the dynamic environments of MANETs and enables the system to make decisions on intrusion while continuing to learn about their mobile environment. An IDS in MANET is a sensoring mechanism that monitors nodes and network activities in order to detect malicious actions and malicious attempt performed by Intruders.

Classification of Heart Rate Data Using BFO-KFCM Clustering and Improved Extreme Learning Machine Classifier,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Mar 2017,"An Electrocardiogram or ECG is an electrical recording of the heart and is used in the investigation of heart disease. The heart rate varies not only in relation to the cardiac demand but is also affected by the presence of cardiac disease and diabetes. Furthermore, it has been shown that Heart Rate Variability (HRV) may be used as an early indicator of cardiac disease susceptibility and the presence of diabetes. Therefore, the heart rate variability may be used for early clinical screening of these diseases. The generalization performance of the SVM classifier is not sufficient for the correct classification of heart rate data. To overcome this problem the Improved Extreme Learning Machine (IELM) classifier is used which works by searching for the best value of the parameters, and upstream by looking for the best subset of features using Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) that feed the classifier. In this work, nine linear and nonlinear features are extracted from the HRV signals. After the preprocessing, feature extraction is done along with feature selection using BFO for data reduction.

Efficient Computer Intrusion Detection Method based on Artificial Bee Colony Optimized Kernel Extreme Learning Machine,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Mar 2014,"With continuous development of computer networks, network attacks threat the information security of people’s daily life. For the protection against network intrusion behaviors, it is imperative to search efficient measurements to maintaining network security. Literature review indicates that taking the advantages of neural network, the network intrusion can be efficiently detected and the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) can provide quick and accurate intrusion detection ability. The only parameter need be determined in KELM is the neuron number of hidden layer. Suitable neuron number will accelerate the training procedure. However, little work has been done to address the optimization of KELM. To address this issue, this paper proposed an effective method that uses the artificial bee colony (ABC) to optimize the KELM.

Obfuscated computer virus detection using machine learning algorithm,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Dec 2019,"Nowadays, computer virus attacks are getting very advanced. New obfuscated computer virus created by computer virus writers will generate a new shape of computer virus automatically for every single iteration and download. This constantly evolving computer virus has caused significant threat to information security of computer users, organizations and even government. However, signature based detection technique which is used by the conventional anti-computer virus software in the market fails to identify it as signatures are unavailable. This research proposed an alternative approach to the traditional signature based detection method and investigated the use of machine learning technique for obfuscated computer virus detection. In this work, text strings are used and have been extracted from virus program codes as the features to generate a suitable classifier model that can correctly classify obfuscated virus files.

KOMPARASI METODE KOMBINASI SELEKSI FITUR DAN MACHINE LEARNING K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR PADA DATASET LABEL HOURS SOFTWARE EFFORT ESTIMATION,Article InfoPublish Date 02 Oct 2019,"The methods for Software Effort Estimation are divided into two, these methods are grouped into Non Machine Learning (non-ML) and Machine Learning (ML) methods [1]. The k-NN method has the disadvantage of being unable to tolerate irrelevant features and greatly affect the accuracy of k-NN. The k-NN method is also difficult to deal with missing data problems and feature categorization problems such as features that are not relevant, weight features that are not optimal, and the same features [2]. Whereas the dataset of Software Effort Estimation still has some serious challenges such as the characteristics of the data set, which are irrelevant features and the level of influence of each feature in the estimated data of the software effort [3]. This study compared the k-NN individual method with the combination of feature selection method with k-NN to find out which method was the best. The results showed that the Forward Selection (FS) method and Median Weighted Information Gain with k-Nearest Neighbor can overcome the problem of irrelevant features so as to increase accuracy in the RMSE Software Effort Estimation dataset, which is smaller in the Albrecht dataset of 5,953 using the Median method -WIG k-NN, the Miyazaki dataset is 55,421 and Kemerer is 123,081 using the FS k-NN method. The combination of kNN with Feature Selection is proven to be able to improve the estimation results better than kNN individuals.

Tomato Growth Stage Monitoring for Smart Farm Using Deep Transfer Learning with Machine Learning-based Maturity Grading,Article InfoPublish Date 20 Jan 2020,"The tomato farming industry needs to adopt new ideas in applying the technology for its growth monitoring and main. Machine vision and image processing techniques have become useful in the increasing need for quality inspection of fruits, particularly, tomatoes. This paper deals with the design and development of a computer-vision monitoring system to assess the growth of tomato plants in a chamber by detecting the presence of flowers and fruits. The system also provides maturity grading for the tomato fruit. Two pre-trained deep transfer learning models were used in the study for the detection of flowers and fruits, namely, the Regional-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) and the Single Shot Detector (SDD). Maturity classification of tomato fruits are implemented using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Evaluation results show that for the detection of flowers and fruits, the over-all accuracy of the R-CNN is 1.67% for flower detection and 19.48% for the fruit detection while SSD registered 100% and 95.99% for flower and fruit detection respectively.

"Size Classification of Tomato Fruit Using Thresholding, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning Techniques",Article InfoPublish Date 28 Oct 2019,"The size of tomato fruits is closely related to the market segment and price. Manual sorting in tomato is very dependent on human interpretation and thus, very prone to error.  The study presents thresholding, machine learning, and deep learning techniques in classifying the tomato as small, medium, and large based from a single tomato fruit image implemented using Open CV libraries and Python programming. Tomato images with different sizes are gathered where features like area, perimeter, and enclosed circle radius are extracted. The experiment shows that using thresholding, a classification accuracy of 85.83%, 65.83%, and 80% was achieved for area, perimeter, and enclosed circle radius, respectively. For machine learning, the training accuracy rates were recorded as 94.00%-95.00% for SVM, 97.50-92.50% for KNN and 90.33-92.50% for ANN. Comparison of models revealed that SVM is the most model without over fitting. The deep learning approach, regardless of the algorithm, produced low performances with 82.31%-78.21%-55.97% training-validation-testing accuracy for VGG16, 48.17%-41.44%-37.64% for InceptionV3, and 56.05%-44.96%-22.78% for ResNet50 models.

Machine Learning Models Based on Random Forest Feature Selection and Bayesian Optimization for Predicting Daily Global Solar Radiation,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Feb 2022,"Prediction of daily global solar radiation Â with simple and highly accurate models would be beneficial for solar energy conversion systems. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid machine learning methodology integrating two feature selection methods and a Bayesian optimization algorithm to predict H in the city of Fez, Morocco. First, we identified the most significant predictors using two Random Forest methods of feature importance: Mean Decrease in Impurity (MDI) and Mean Decrease in Accuracy (MDA). Then, based on the feature selection results, ten models were developed and compared: (1) five standalone machine learning (ML) models including Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forests (RF), Bagged Trees Regression (BTR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP); and (2) the same models tuned by the Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm: CART-BO, RF-BO, BTR-BO, SVR-BO, and MLP-BO. Both MDI and MDA techniques revealed that extraterrestrial solar radiation and sunshine duration fraction were the most influential features. The BO approach improved the predictive accuracy of MLP, CART, SVR, and BTR models and prevented the CART model from overfitting. The best improvements were obtained using the MLP model, where RMSE and MAE were reduced by 17.6% and 17.2%, respectively.

On the benefit of logic-based machine learning to learn pairwise comparisons,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Dec 2020,"In recent years, many daily processes such as internet web searching, e-mail filter-ing, social media services, e-commerce have benefited from machine learning tech-niques (ML). The implementation of ML techniques has been largely focused on blackbox methods where the general conclusions are not easily interpretable. Hence, theelaboration with other declarative software models to identify the correctness and com-pleteness of the models is not easy to perform. On the other hand, the emerge of somelogic-based machine learning techniques with their advantage of white box approachhave been proven to be well-suited for many software engineering tasks. In this paper,we propose the use of a logic-based approach to learn user preference in the form ofpairwise comparisons. APARELL as a novel approach of inductive learning is able tomodel the user’s preferences in description logic representation. This offers a rich, re-lational representation which is then can be used to produce a set of recommendations.A user study has been performed in our experiment to evaluate the implementation ofpairwise preference recommender system when compared to a standard list interface.The result of the experiment shows that the pairwise interface was significantly betterthan the other interface in many ways.",Bulletin of Electrical Engineering and Informatics,http://beei.org/index.php/EEI,Universitas Ahmad Dahlan,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/8,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/100"">Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineering</a>"

Method to implement K-NN machine learning to classify data privacy in IoT environment,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Nov 2020,"Internet of Things technology allows many devices to connect with each other. The interaction could be between humans and devices or between devices itself. In fact, the data are traveling between the devices through the media within the boundary, and it could be traveling outside the boundary when it required to be analyzed or stored in the cloud through the internet. Due the transmission media and internet, the data are vulnerable to attacks. Thus, the data need to be encrypted strongly for the purpose of protection. Usually, most of the encryption techniques will consume computer resources. In this work, we divide the data that are used in the IoT environment into three levels of sensitivity which are low, medium and high sensitive data to leverage the computer resources such as time of encryption and decryption, battery usage and so on. A framework is proposed in this work to encrypt the data depends on the level of sensitivity using the machine learning K nearest neighbors (K-NN).",Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,http://ijeecs.iaescore.com/index.php/IJEECS,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6,

And it is useful to predict the system resource utilization state efficiently for determining the rejuvenation time. In this paper, we propose software aging prediction model based on extreme learning machine (ELM) for a real VOD system. First, the data on the parameters of system resources and application server are collected. Then, the data is preprocessed by normalization and principal component analysis (PCA). Then, ELMs are constructed to model the extracted data series of systematic parameters. Finally, we get the predicted data of system resource by computing the sum of the outputs of these ELMs. Experiments show that the proposed software aging prediction method based on wavelet transform and ELM is superior to the artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) in the aspects of prediction precision and efficiency.

Neuro-physiological porn addiction detection using machine learning approach,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Nov 2019,"Pornography is a portrayal of sexual subject contents for the exclusive purpose of sexual arousal that can lead to addiction. The availability and easy accessibility of the Internet connectivity have created unprecedented opportunities for sexual education, learning, and growth for adolescences to be in the rise. Hence, the risk of porn addiction developed by teenagers has also increased due to highly prevalent porn consumption. To date, the only available means of detecting porn addiction is through questionnaire. However, while answering the questions, participants may suppress or exaggerate their answers because porn addiction is considered taboo in the community. Hence, the purpose of this project is to develop an engine with multiple classifiers to recognize porn addiction using electroencephalography (EEG) signals and to compare classifiers performance. In the experimental study, the neuro-physiological signals of EEG data were collected previously in Indonesia among students age 9 to 13 years old by researchers from the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). The EEG data were pre-processed, and relevant features are extracted using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). Then, the features are classified to produce the outputs of valance and arousal. Subsequently, three different classifiers of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Naive Bayesian (NB), and Random Forest (RF) are employed to determine whether the participant is a porn addict or otherwise. The experimental results show that the MLP classifier yields slightly better accuracy compared to Naïve Bayes and Random Forest classifiers making the MLP classifier preferable for porn addiction recognition. Although this work is still at infancy stage, it is envisaged for the work to be expanded for comprehensive porn addiction recognition system so that early intervention and appropriate support can be given for the teenagers with pornography addiction problem.",Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,http://ijeecs.iaescore.com/index.php/IJEECS,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6,
I-OnAR: a rule-based machine learning approach for intelligent assessment in an online learning environment,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Feb 2020,"Intelligent systems are created to automate decision making process that is similar to human intelligence. Incorporating intelligent component has achieved promising results in many applications, including in education. Intelligence modules in a tutoring system would bring the application and its capability closer to a human's ability to serve its human users and to solve problems. However, the majority of the online learning provided in the literature review especially in Malaysia, normally only provide the lecture notes, assignments and tests and rarely suggest or give feedbacks on what the students should study or do next in order to fully understand the subjects. Hence, the researchers propose an online learning environment called Intelligent Online Assessment and Revision (I-OnAR). It facilitates the learning process at multiple learning phases such as test creation, materials revision, feedback for improvement and performance analysis. These components are incorporated into the tutoring system to assist self-pace learning at anytime and anywhere. The intelligent agent uses a Rule-based Machine Learning method for the adaptive capabilities such as automated test creation and feedbacks for improvement. The system has been tested on a group of students and found to be useful to support learning process. The results have shown that 60% of the subjects’ performance have improved with the help of the system. The students were given feedbacks on the topic they did poorly as well as how to improve their performance. This proves that the Intelligent Online Assessment and revision (I-OnAR) can be a useful tool to help online students intelligently, systematically and efficiently.

It determines the balance in water nutrients, adequate temperature and lighting, other environmental factors, and the system’s productivity to sustain cultivars. This paper proposes a classification of lettuce life stages planted in an aquaponics system. The classification was done using the texture features of the leaves derived from machine vision algorithms. The attributes underwent three different feature selection processes, namely: Univariate Selection (US), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and Feature Importance (FI) to determine the four most significant features from the original eight attributes. The features selected were used for training four estimators from Decision Trees Classifier (DTC), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The models trained using DTC and SGD were then optimized as they have hyperparameters for tuning. A comparative analysis among Machine Learning (ML) algorithms was conducted to identify the best-performing model with the given application. The best features were derived from US and FI as they have the same top four features using the DTC estimator optimized with the hyperparameters tuned to max depth having 5, criterion equated to ‘Gini', and splitter was set to 'Best'. The accuracy obtained from cross-validation evaluation resulted in 87.92%. Considering consistency with hold-out validation, LDA outperforms optimized DTC even with lower accuracy of 86.67%.

Additionally, server profile pulling, forecasting server resources, and dispatching should be asynchronous with the request listener of the load balancer to minimize response delay. For production use, we recommend that the load balancer should have friendly user interface to make it easier to be configured, such as adding resources of servers as parameter criteria.

Dynamic composition components based on machine learning: architecture design and process,Article InfoPublish Date 01 May 2021,"The dynamic composition of components is an emerging concept that aims to allow a new application to be constructed based on a user’s request. Three main ingredients must be used to achieve the dynamic composition of components: goal, scenario, and context-awareness. These three ingredients must be completed by artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that help process discovery and storage. This paper presents framework architecture for the dynamic composition of components that can extract expressed goals, deduce implicit ones using AI. The goal will be combined with pertinent contextual data, to compose the relevant components that meet the real requirements of the user. The core element of our proposed architecture is the composer component that (i) negotiate user goal, (ii) load the associated scenarios and choose the most suitable one based on user goal and profile, (iii) get binding information of scenario’s actions, (iv) compose the loaded actions, and (v) store the new component as a tree of actions enabled by contextual or process constraint. In our e-learning proven of concept, we consider five components: composer component, reader component, formatter component, matcher component, and executor component. These five components stipulate that a course is the combination of existing/scrapped chapters that have been adapted to a user profile in terms of language, level of difficulty, and prerequisite.

The Empirical Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithm for the Class Imbalanced Problem in Conformational Epitope Prediction,Article InfoPublish Date 22 May 2021,"A conformational epitope is a part of a protein-based vaccine. It is challenging to identify using an experiment. A computational model is developed to support identification. However, the imbalance class is one of the constraints to achieving optimal performance on the conformational epitope B cell prediction. In this paper, we compare several conformational epitope B cell prediction models from non-ensemble and ensemble approaches. A sampling method from Random undersampling, SMOTE, and cluster-based undersampling is combined with a decision tree or SVM to build a non-ensemble model. A random forest model and several variants of the bagging method is used to construct the ensemble model. A 10-fold cross-validation method is used to validate the model.  The experiment results show that the combination of the cluster-based under-sampling and decision tree outperformed the other sampling method when combined with the non-ensemble and the ensemble method. This study provides a baseline to improve existing models for dealing with the class imbalance in the conformational epitope prediction.",JUITA : Jurnal Informatika,https://jurnalnasional.ump.ac.id/index.php/JUITA,Universitas Muhammadiyah Purwokerto,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/26,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"

A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL FOR SOBRIETY AND RELAPSE ANALYSIS IN DRUG REHABILITATION,Article InfoPublish Date 14 Jun 2021,"Drug abuse has become so paramount among members of society. Although, the initial decision to take drugs is typically voluntary among victims. As drugs are constantly been used, the ability to exert self-control on them is relatively impaired. Thus, abuse is witnessed in different age groups, gender, and celebrities from all walks of life. While addicts become such owing to several factors of curiosity and peer pressure, recreational purpose, source of inspiration, and more, the effect of these drugs can lead to depression, brain stimulation, and hallucination. Managing drug abuse through behavioral or pharmacological means is intended to help addicts stop habitual drug use. Oftentimes, rehab is not effective because the desired change is absent while a proper technological-driven approach to track sobriety and relapse in compulsive drug seeking and usage is also missing. Consequently, in this research, user-friendly and interactive sobriety and relapse predictive management application is developed. Here, addicts' behavioral and demographics with major relapse monitoring factors were clustered to predict the likelihood of relapse. The relapse predictive system using cognitive behavioral patterns, adopts the logistic regression algorithm of the Bayesian network for both training and testing. The essence is to ascertain users’ addiction level, analyze and track sobriety and relapse in order to uncover drug addiction patterns, discover the probability of relapse occurrence towards recommending sustainable rehabilitation decision support",IJISCS (International Journal Of Information System and Computer Science),http://ojs.stmikpringsewu.ac.id/index.php/ijiscs,STMIK Pringsewu Lampung,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/816,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"

Klasifikasi Gangguan Tidur REM Behaviour Disorder Berdasarkan Sinyal EEG menggunakan Machine Learning,Article InfoPublish Date 29 Dec 2020,"REM Behavior Disorder (RBD) is a sleep disorder characterized by the loss of normal muscle atony (loss of paralysis) during Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep, where sufferers act on dreams that can result in physical injury to individuals or their sleep partners. REM is a sleep stage characterized by cessation of eye movement, a decrease in body temperature, slow heart rate and no muscle activity in several parts of the body. One of the methods used to detect RBD is Electroencephalography (EEG). EEG is a method of recording or capturing electrical activity in the brain. The dataset used was sourced from PhysioNet.org which consisted of 2 classes, namely normal class and RBD class which were taken from 26 subjects with 6 normal subjects and 20 RBD subjects. This research was conducted to classify RBD sleep disorders based on EEG signals using the ELM algorithm and it is expected to determine the best algorithm for classifying RBD sleep disorders using the ELM algorithm which will be compared with the SVM and backpropagation algorithms based on the EEG signal in terms of the resulting accuracy value and also the time required. to create a model in the algorithm classification process. Classification of RBD sleep disorders based on EEG signals begins with data pre-processing, feature extraction and classification. Data pre-processing includes signal splitting per 30 seconds and data smoothing. The feature extraction process uses Discrete Wavelet Transformation. The RBD classification process based on EEG signals uses the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm with the binary sigmoid activation function. Prior to the training process on the ELM algorithm, undersampling was first carried out to overcome the imbalance in the number of classes. Evaluation of the classification results is done by using k-fold cross-validation. The classification results of RBD sleep disorders based on EEG signals using the ELM algorithm show that the ELM algorithm can classify RBD and non-RBD sleep disorders based on EEG signals with an average accuracy value of 70.71% ± 5.44. The comparison result states that the backpropagation algorithm has the best average accuracy in RBD classification based on EEG signals, reaching 83.81% ± 1.40. However, based on the computation of time, the ELM algorithm is superior in the speed of the RBD classification process based on EEG signals, reaching 0.04 ± 0.06 seconds compared to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and backpropagation.",Jurnal Sistem Cerdas,https://apic.id/jurnal/index.php/jsc,Asosiasi Prakarsa Indonesia Cerdas,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/1226,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/30"">Automotive Engineering</a>"

Manual identification takes a long time and tends to be subjective depending on the staff's experience, so the automatic identification of white blood cells will be faster and more accurate. White blood cells are identified by examining a colored blood smear (SADT) and examined under a digital microscope to obtain a cell image. Image identification of white blood cells is determined through HSV color space segmentation (Hue, Saturation Value) and feature extraction of the Gray Level Cooccurrence Matrix (GLCM) method using the Angular Second Moment (ASM), Contrast, Entropy, and Inverse Different Moment (IDM) features. The purpose of this study was to identify white blood cells by comparing the classification accuracy of the K-nearest neighbor (KNN), NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classification (NBC), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) methods. The classification results of 100 training data and 50 white blood cell image testing data. Tests on the KNN, NBC, and MLP methods yielded an accuracy of 82%, 80%, and 94%, respectively. Therefore, MLP was chosen as the best classification model in the identification of white blood cells.",JOIN (Jurnal Online Informatika),http://join.if.uinsgd.ac.id/index.php/join,Universitas Islam Negeri Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/210,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"

Machine learning model for clinical named entity recognition,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Apr 2021,"To extract important concepts (named entities) from clinical notes, most widely used NLP task is named entity recognition (NER). It is found from the literature that several researchers have extensively used machine learning models for clinical NER.The most fundamental tasks among the medical data mining tasks are medical named entity recognition and normalization. Medical named entity recognition is different from general NER in various ways. Huge number of alternate spellings and synonyms create explosion of word vocabulary sizes. This reduces the medicine dictionary efficiency. Entities often consist of long sequences of tokens, making harder to detect boundaries exactly. The notes written by clinicians written notes are less structured and are in minimal grammatical form with cryptic short hand. Because of this, it poses challenges in named entity recognition. Generally, NER systems are either rule based or pattern based. The rules and patterns are not generalizable because of the diverse writing style of clinicians. The systems that use machine learning based approach to resolve these issues focus on choosing effective features for classifier building. In this work, machine learning based approach has been used to extract the clinical data in a required manner",International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering,http://ijece.iaescore.com/index.php/IJECE,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"

Optimization of network traffic anomaly detection using machine learning,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Jun 2021,"In this paper, to optimize the process of detecting cyber-attacks, we choose to propose 2 main optimization solutions: Optimizing the detection method and optimizing features. Both of these two optimization solutions are to ensure the aim is to increase accuracy and reduce the time for analysis and detection. Accordingly, for the detection method, we recommend using the Random Forest supervised classification algorithm. The experimental results in section 4.1 have proven that our proposal that use the Random Forest algorithm for abnormal behavior detection is completely correct because the results of this algorithm are much better than some other detection algorithms on all measures.

An algorithm for characterizing skin moles using image processing and machine learning,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Aug 2021,"Melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer, forms in cells (melanocytes) that produce melanin, the pigment that gives color to the skin. There are low-income regions that lack specialized dermatologists, causing skin cancer to be diagnosed in advanced stages. In Peru, in high Andean communities with low resources, the problem is aggravated by the high incidence of ultraviolet radiation and lack of medical resources to make the diagnosis. Normally, mole images are obtained from dermatoscopes. The present work seeks to use mole images obtained from smartphones to make the classification of them as suspected or not suspected of being melanoma, by means of a feature extraction algorithm. The first step is to make color and lighting corrections. After this, the image is segmented using the K-Means algorithm, and we obtain the areas of the mole and skin. With the segmented mole we proceed to extract the main visual characteristics and then use classification algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest and naïve bayes, which obtained an accuracy of 0.9473, 0.7368 and 0.6842, respectively.

Machine learning based multi class fault diagnosis tool for voltage source inverter driven induction motor,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Jun 2021,"AC drives are employed in process industries for varying applications resulting in a wide range of ratings. The entire process industry has seen a paradigm shift from manual to automated systems. The major factor contributing to this is the advanced power electronics technology enabling power electronic drives for smooth control of electric motors. Induction motors are most commonly used in industries. Faults in the power electronic circuits may occur periodically. These faults often go unnoticed as they rarely cause a complete shutdown and the fault levels may not be large enough to lead to a breakdown of the drive. An early detection of these faults is required to prevent their escalation into major faults. The diagnostic tool for detection of faults requires real time monitoring of the entire drive. In this work, detailed investigation of different faults that can occur in the power electronic circuit of an industrial drive is carried out.

Using machine learning to predict the number of alternative solutions to a minimum cardinality set covering problem,Article InfoPublish Date 24 Feb 2021,"Although the characterization of alternative optimal solutions for linear programming problems is well known, such characterizations for combinatorial optimization problems are essentially non-existent. This is the first article to qualitatively predict the number of alternative optima for a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, namely, the minimum cardinality (also called unicost) set covering problem (MCSCP). For the MCSCP, a set must be covered by a minimum number of subsets selected from a specified collection of subsets of the given set. The MCSCP has numerous industrial applications that require that a secondary objective is optimized once the size of a minimum cover has been determined. To optimize the secondary objective, the number of MCSCP solutions is optimized. In this article, for the first time, a machine learning methodology is presented to generate categorical regression trees to predict, qualitatively (extra-small, small, medium, large, or extra-large), the number of solutions to an MCSCP. Within the machine learning toolbox of MATLABÂ®, 600,000 unique random MCSCPs were generated and used to construct regression trees. The prediction quality of these regression trees was tested on 5000 different MCSCPs. For the 5-output model, the average accuracy of being at most one off from the predicted category was 94.2%.Â ",International Journal of Industrial Optimization (IJIO),http://journal2.uad.ac.id/index.php/ijio,Universitas Ahmad Dahlan,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/8,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/80"">Decision Sciences, Operations Research &amp; Management </a>"

Salah satu penyebab terjadinya kegagalan dari proses telemarketing adalah tidak adanya proses seleksi untuk mengetahui potensi dari calon pelanggan. Machine learning menjadi salah satu alternatif yang dapat digunakan untuk membantu memilih dan menentukan calon pelanggan potensial dan sesuai dengan target perusahaan. Akan tetapi, missing values yang ada pada data telemarketing seringkali menjadi permasalahan baru yang harus ditangani agar penggunaan machine learning menjadi lebih efektif dan mendukung keberhasilah telemarketing. Pada penelitian ini, K-means digunakan sebagai salah satu cara untuk menangani adanya missing values pada data telemarketing. Hasilnya, terdapat peningkatan hingga sebesar 6% jika diukur berdasarkan nilai akurasi menggunakan model Decision Tree.

After that authors evaluate using confusion matrix, accuracy rate and classification report. In this research, authors found there are positive, negative, and neutral sentiments expressed on the online school implementation through comments. Authors ranked top three most used words used to express positive sentiments which includes bahagia, rajin and senang. On negative sentiments, top three words are capek, muak and bosen. On neutral sentiments, top three words are tidur, capek, and buka. Lengthy Tweets are usually imbued with negative remarks. On the other hand, the tweet tends to be positive and neutral tweet is usually stable. Authors conclude that the weakness of online school is the amount of workload that makes students tired alongside ineffective teaching method which makes it hard for students to understand the material given by school. However, on the positive side, some people agree with policies that are implemented and they feel like they gained some benefits from the implementation.

Derating dapat menyebabkan penurunan kinerja dan produksi listrik pada generator. Kapasitas produksi listrik yang menurun nantinya akan menjadi masalah jika melihat kondisi konsumsi listrik nasional yang terus meningkat dari tahun ke tahun. Derating sering kali terjadi karena suhu yang tinggi pada charge air. Pencegahan derating dapat dilakukan dengan mengimplementasikan strategi maintenance yang mampu memprediksi derating dan mengakomodasi perubahan suhu charge air sebagai penyebab terjadinya derating. Penelitian ini akan memperlihatkan rancangan implementasi strategi maintenance berbasis data untuk memprediksi terjadinya derating dengan menggunakan pendekatan machine learning. Rancangan proses ini akan memberikan gambaran proses seperti apa yang dapat digunakan untuk mencegah derating sehingga membantu menjaga performa generator. Tahapan implementasi machine learning dilakukan dengan mengimpelementasikan proses knowledge discovery from data pada proses yang ada dalam maintenance management. Evaluasi terkait proses maintenance management dan machine learning menunjukkan bahwa machine learning dapat diimplementasikan pada tahap controlling. Klasifikasi kondisi generator juga didasarkan pada trend kondisi suhu charge air sehingga prediksi kondisi generator terkait derating tidak dipengaruhi oleh perubahan suhu yang bersifat cepat dan sementara. Penjabaran proses yang ada menunjukkan bahwa implementasi machine learning dalam maintenance management ini mungkin untuk dilakukan. Abstract[Designing The Implementation Process of Machine Learning in Maintenance Management to Avoid Derating] Derating is problem that often arises in power plant. Derating force generator to work below its optimum performance and resulting low production rate of electricity. Declining of electricity production capacity can be problem when we see condition of national electricity consumption in Indonesia which continues to increase year over year. Derating often occurs due to high temperatures in charge air. Derating prevention can be done by implementing maintenance strategy that is able to predict derating and accommodate changes in charge air temperature. This study designs processes of implementing data-based maintenance strategy to predict occurrence of derating using machine learning approach. Process design will provide overview of what kind of process can be used to avoid derating so that it helps maintain generator performance. Machine learning implementation can be done by implementing process of knowledge discovery from data in existing maintenance management process. Evaluations related to maintenance management and machine learning processes show that machine learning can be implemented at controlling stage. Classification of generator conditions is based on trend of charge air temperature so that prediction of generator conditions will not be affected by temporary changes in temperature. Process overview concludes that it is possible to implement machine learning in maintenance management.Keywords: decision tree; derating; machine learning; maintenance management,J@TI (TEKNIK INDUSTRI),https://ejournal.undip.ac.id/index.php/jgti,Universitas Diponegoro,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/7,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/132"">Industrial &amp; Manufacturing Engineering</a>"

A Machine Learning Framework for Improving Classification Performance on Credit Approval,Article InfoPublish Date 30 Jun 2021,"Credit scoring is a model commonly used in the decision-making process to refuse or accept loan requests. The credit score model depends on the type of loan or credit and is complemented by various credit factors. At present, there is no accurate model for determining which creditors are eligible for loans. Therefore, an accurate and automatic model is needed to make it easier for banks to determine appropriate creditors. To address the problem, we propose a new approach using the combination of a machine learning algorithm (NaÃ¯ve Bayes), Information Gain (IG), and discretization in classifying creditors. This research work employed an experimental method using the Weka application. Australian Credit Approval data was used as a dataset, which contains 690 instances of data. In this study, Information Gain is employed as a feature selection to select relevant features so that the NaÃ¯ve Bayes algorithm can work optimally. The confusion matrix is used as an evaluator and 10-fold cross-validation as a validator. Based on experimental results, our proposed method could improve the classification performance, which reached the highest performance in average accuracy, precision, recall, and f-measure with the value of 86.29%, 86.33%, 86.29%, 86.30%, and 91.52%, respectively.

Optimized machine learning algorithm for intrusion detection,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Oct 2021,"Intrusion detection is mainly achieved by using optimization algorithms. The need for optimization algorithms for intrusion detection is necessitated by the increasing number of features in audit data, as well as the performance failure of the human-based smart intrusion detection system (IDS) in terms of their prolonged training time and classification accuracy. This article presents an improved intrusion detection technique for binary classification. The proposal is a combination of different optimizers, including Rao optimization algorithm, extreme learning machine (ELM), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR) (for feature selection & weighting), as well as a hybrid Rao-SVM algorithm with supervised machine learning (ML) techniques for feature subset selection (FSS). The process of selecting the least number of features without sacrificing the FSS accuracy was considered a multi-objective optimization problem. The algorithm-specific, parameter-less concept of the proposed Rao-SVM was also explored in this study. The KDDCup 99 and CICIDS 2017 were used as the intrusion dataset for the experiments, where significant improvements were noted with the new Rao-SVM compared to the other algorithms. Rao-SVM presented better results than many existing works by reaching 100% accuracy for KDDCup 99 dataset and 97% for CICIDS dataset.",Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,http://ijeecs.iaescore.com/index.php/IJEECS,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6,

Support Directional Shifting Vector: A Direction Based Machine Learning Classifier,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Oct 2021,"Machine learning models have been very popular nowadays for providing rigorous solutions to complicated real-life problems. There are three main domains named supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement. Supervised learning mainly deals with regression and classification. There exist several types of classification algorithms, and these are based on various bases. The classification performance varies based on the dataset velocity and the algorithm selection. In this article, we have focused on developing a model of angular nature that performs supervised classification. Here, we have used two shifting vectors named Support Direction Vector (SDV) and Support Origin Vector (SOV) to form a linear function. These vectors form a linear function to measure cosine-angle with both the target class data and the non-target class data. Considering target data points, the linear function takes such a position that minimizes its angle with target class data and maximizes its angle with non-target class data. The positional error of the linear function has been modelled as a loss function which is iteratively optimized using the gradient descent algorithm. In order to justify the acceptability of this method, we have implemented this model on three different standard datasets. The model showed comparable accuracy with the existing standard supervised classification algorithm. Doi: 10.28991/esj-2021-01306 Full Text: PDF",Emerging Science Journal,http://ijournalse.org/index.php/ESJ,Ital Publication,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/683,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/120"">Environmental Science</a>"
Machine Learning Bias in Predicting High School Grades: A Knowledge Perspective,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Oct 2021,"This study focuses on the machine learning bias when predicting teacher grades. The experimental phase consists of predicting the student grades of 11th and 12thgrade Portuguese high school grades and computing the bias and variance decomposition. In the base implementation, only the academic achievement critical factors are considered. In the second implementation, the preceding year’s grade is appended as an input variable. The machine learning algorithms in use are random forest, support vector machine, and extreme boosting machine. The reasons behind the poor performance of the machine learning algorithms are either the input space poor preciseness or the lack of a sound record of student performance. We introduce the new concept of knowledge bias and a new predictive model classification. Precision education would reduce bias by providing low-bias intensive-knowledge models. To avoid bias, it is not necessary to add knowledge to the input space. Low-bias extensive-knowledge models are achievable simply by appending the student’s earlier performance record to the model. The low-bias intensive-knowledge learning models promoted by precision education are suited to designing new policies and actions toward academic attainments. If the aim is solely prediction, deciding for a low bias knowledge-extensive model can be appropriate and correct. Doi: 10.28991/esj-2021-01298 Full Text: PDF",Emerging Science Journal,http://ijournalse.org/index.php/ESJ,Ital Publication,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/683,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/120"">Environmental Science</a>"

"Pemetaan Daerah Rawan Longsor Menggunakan Machine Learning di Kecamatan Muara Tami, Kota Jayapura, Papua",Article InfoPublish Date 12 Oct 2021,"One of the high landslide vulnerability areas in Indonesia is located in Muara Tami District, Jayapura City. The main factors triggering the landslide are steep slopes and high elevations. However, there are still several other factors that also influence the occurrence of landslides, such as vegetation, land cover, and curvature. Landslides that occur can cause damages to all parties, both material and non-material. Therefore, it is necessary to map landslide-prone areas as a non-structural mitigation planning. This planning is useful for identifying areas that are relatively safer from landslides so that the fatalities incurred can be minimized. In this mapping, several parameters are used that are thought to trigger landslides, then they are calculated by machine learning using the random forest method. Based on the parameters used, the eastern and northwestern areas have high slope and elevation values, high curvature contrast values, and dry land forest cover. These results indicate the high potential for landslide vulnerability in both parts of the study area. Meanwhile, areas with low potential for landslide vulnerability have a curvature of 0, a relatively low slope and elevation. The model accuracy value obtained by the random forest method is 0.9. This value is categorized as good enough because it shows that the parameters used are good enough in mapping landslide vulnerability in the study area. These results are also supported by the high sensitivity and specificity values ​​based on the ROC curve. Areas with high potential for landslide vulnerability are Mosso Village and the border between Skow Mabo, Skow Yambe, Koya Tengah, Koya Timur, and Holtekam. Meanwhile, areas with low landslide potential were Skow Sae Village, the central part of East Koya, the northern part of West Koya, and the southern part of Holtekam.",Jurnal Geofisika,https://jurnal-geofisika.or.id/index.php/jurnal-geofisika,Himpunan Ahli Geofisika Indonesia,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/1617,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/90"">Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences</a>"

Using machine learning to predict the number of alternative solutions to a minimum cardinality set covering problem,Article InfoPublish Date 24 Feb 2021,"Although the characterization of alternative optimal solutions for linear programming problems is well known, such characterizations for combinatorial optimization problems are essentially non-existent. This is the first article to qualitatively predict the number of alternative optima for a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, namely, the minimum cardinality (also called unicost) set covering problem (MCSCP). For the MCSCP, a set must be covered by a minimum number of subsets selected from a specified collection of subsets of the given set. The MCSCP has numerous industrial applications that require that a secondary objective is optimized once the size of a minimum cover has been determined. To optimize the secondary objective, the number of MCSCP solutions is optimized. In this article, for the first time, a machine learning methodology is presented to generate categorical regression trees to predict, qualitatively (extra-small, small, medium, large, or extra-large), the number of solutions to an MCSCP. Within the machine learning toolbox of MATLABÂ®, 600,000 unique random MCSCPs were generated and used to construct regression trees. The prediction quality of these regression trees was tested on 5000 different MCSCPs. For the 5-output model, the average accuracy of being at most one off from the predicted category was 94.2%.Â ",International Journal of Industrial Optimization (IJIO),http://journal2.uad.ac.id/index.php/ijio,Universitas Ahmad Dahlan,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/8,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/80"">Decision Sciences, Operations Research &amp; Management </a>"

Sistem Cerdas Permainan Papan The Battle Of Honor dengan Decision Making dan Machine Learning,Article InfoPublish Date 02 Nov 2021,"Abstract. Intelligent System of the Battle of Honor Board Game with Decision Making and Machine Learning. The Battle of Honor is a board game where 2 players face each other to bring down their opponent's flag. This game requires a third party to act as the referee because the players cannot see each other's pawns during the game. The solution to this is to implement Rule-Based Systems (RBS) on a system developed with Unity to support the referee's role in making decisions based on the rules of the game. Researchers also develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) as opposed to applying Case-Based reasoning (CBR). The application of CBR is supported by the nearest neighbor algorithm to find cases that have a high degree of similarity.

The algorithm used is based on machine learning type of artificial neural network which compares backpropagation and bayessian regularization. The results obtained show that bayessian regularization outperforms backpropagation with the smallest MSE and the highest accuracy and the shortest computation time to determine sunny, cloudy, light rain and heavy rain forecasts. The unbalanced distribution of data causes fluctuations in the MSE calculation and accuracy. The addition of training will improve system performance which is indicated by a significant increase in accuracy.

Therefore, the significance of classifying network data streams to improve network system quality and security is attracting increasing study interests. This work introduces a machine learning-based approach to find the most suitable training model for network traffic classification tasks. Data pre-processing is first applied to normalize each feature type in the dataset. Different machine learning techniques, including k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Random Forest (RF), are applied based on the normalized features in the classification phase. An open-access dataset ISCXVPN2016 is applied for this research, which includes two types of encryption (VPN and Non-VPN) and seven classes of traffic categories classes. Experimental results on the open dataset have shown that the proposed models have reached a high classification rate – over 85% in some cases, in which the RF model obtains the most refined results among the three techniques.",Knowledge Engineering and Data Science,http://journal2.um.ac.id/index.php/keds,Universitas Negeri Malang,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/16,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"

Fast and accurate primary user detection with machine learning techniques for cognitive radio networks,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Jan 2021,"Spectrum decision is an important and crucial task for the secondary user to avail the unlicensed spectrum for transmission. Managing the spectrum is an efficient one for spectrum sensing. Determining the primary user presence in the spectrum is an essential work for using the licensed spectrum of primary user. The information which lacks in managing the spectrum are the information about the primary user presence, accuracy in determining the existence of user in the spectrum, the cost for computation and difficult in finding the user in low signal-to noise ratio (SNR) values. The proposed system overcomes the above limitations. In the proposed system, the various techniques of machine learning like decision tree, support vector machines, naive bayes, ensemble based trees, nearest neighbour’s and logistic regression are used for testing the algorithm. As a first step, the spectrum sensing is done in two stages with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing and Energy Detection algorithm at the various values of SNR. The results generated from the above algorithm is used for database generation.

Efficient electro encephelogram classification system using support vector machine classifier and adaptive learning technique,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Jan 2022,"Complex modern signal processing is used to automate the analysis of electro encephelogram (EEG) signals. For the diagnosis of seizures, approaches that are simple and precise may be preferable rather than difficult and time-consuming. In this paper, efficient EEG classification system using support vector machine (SVM) and Adaptive learning technique is proposed. The database EEG signals are subjected to temporal and spatial filtering to remove unwanted noise and to increase the detection accuracy of the classifier by selecting the specific bands in which most of the EEG data are present. The neural network based SVM is used to classify the test EEG data with respect to training data. The cost-sensitive SVM with proposed Adaptive learning classifies the EEG signals where the adaptive learning with probability based function helps in prediction of the future samples and this leads in improving the accuracy with detection time. The detection accuracy of the proposed algorithm is compared with existing which shows that the proposed algorithm can classify the EEG signal more effectively.",Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,http://ijeecs.iaescore.com/index.php/IJEECS,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6,

This paper proposes a PdM model that utilizes machine learning to predict the system’s operational status after M active steps based on L previous observations implemented by a feedforward neural network (FFNN). We use quantization and encoding schemes to reduce the complexity of the system. We apply the proposed model to build a PdM system for wireless sensors networks (WSNs), where our concern is to predict the state of the system as far as the quality of data transfer is concerned. The FFNN provides a forward prediction of the operational status of the network after M consecutive time steps in the future, based on the previous L readings of quality of service (QoS) requirements of WSN. We also demonstrate the relation between complexity and accuracy. We found that larger M leads to higher complexity and larger prediction error, where larger L entails higher complexity and smaller prediction error.

These latter are more robust and precise, but they are generally under the restricted predictive ability due to the particular set of conditions. On the other hand, Machine learning models can be highly efficient in the modeling phase by allowing the management of high and massive dimensional sets of data to predict the best behavior of bio composites. In this situation, biomaterial scientists would like to benefit from the comprehension and implementation of the powerful ML models to characterize or predict the bio composites.

Another condition is that several power plant and substation construction projects have fulfilled the realization commitment to the RUPTL from PT PLN (Persero). This has resulted in PT PLN (Persero) being faced with an over supply condition between power capacity and customer usage load. Realization of sales growth until July 2021 was 4.44% (144,788 TWh). Energy consumption in July 2021 was 20.55 TWh where the growth of kWh sales in July 2021 comparing with July 2020 began to show a recovery of +1.82%. The factor that most affected business and industrial growth was the manufacturing sector in Indonesia experiencing a slowdown/contraction as reflected in the PMI (Purchasing Managers Index) which decreased from 53.5 to 40.1. Growth is strongly influenced by consumer behavior in responding to government regulations, especially related to controlling the spread of Covid-19 in Indonesia in the form of restrictions on social activities (PSBB, PPKM, or Lockdown) which have been effectively implemented since April 2020 until now. Based on the analysis of the customer's electrical energy consumption data per industrial sector, as well as using technical data on the availability of power per electrical sub-system and the cost of producing electrical energy in an area, an evaluation model will be obtained that can be used in selecting the criteria for prospective customers who will be given program offers ""SEMAKIN PRODUKTIF"".

SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF INDONESIA’S DIGITAL WALLET USING COMBINATION MACHINE LEARNING AND EMOTICON WEIGHT,Article InfoPublish Date 20 Jan 2022,"Opinions on social media can be used to determine user sentiment by using sentiment analysis concept. Sentiment analysis requires several important stages, namely, preprocessing, feature extraction and classification method stages. The preprocessing stage was carried out to eliminate inconsistent data. In previous research, punctuation marks removal was applied at the preprocessing stage which can eliminate the emoticon position. Emoticons are a combination of punctuation marks. According to previous research, the emoticon feature has no contribution in sentiment analysis. There is another suggestion to maintain an emoticon position like converting an emoticon into a more relevant word such as :) into a “smile”. However, the feature of emoticon weights has not been considered in the sentiment analysis process. In order to consider the role of emoticons and to improve sentiment analysis performance, we propose using a combination of machine learning and emoticon weights. We perform emoticon weight based on probability and sentiment score. Each probability value and sentiment score of the emoticon will be normalized using the z-score method. There are several machine learning methods that have the best classification success rates, namely, Naïve Bayes and SVM. Based on the evaluation results of the proposed model, the best accuracy is 87% - 89% when using the combination of machine learning and emoticon sentiment score. Based on the results also show that the emoticon sentiment score has a significant effect on the accuracy of sentiment analysis.",Jurnal Ilmiah Teknologi dan Rekayasa,https://ejournal.gunadarma.ac.id/index.php/tekno,Universitas Gunadarma,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/51,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/30"">Automotive Engineering</a>"

However, production result looks scattered and appears to have no direct correlation to individual parameters. It also tend to have a decreasing trend, hence the success ratio needs to be increased. Hydraulic fracturing in the South Sumatra area has been implemented since 2002 and there is plenty of data that can be analyzed to resolve the relationship between actual production with reservoir parameters and fracturing treatment. Empirical correlation approach and machine learning (ML) methods are both used to evaluate this relationship. Concept of Darcy's equation is utilized as basis for the empirical correlation on the actual data. The ML method is then applied to provide better predictions both for production rate and water cut. This method has also been developed to solve data limitations so that the prediction method can be used for all wells. Empirical correlation can gives an R2Â of 0.67, while ML can gives a better R2Â that is close to 0.80. Furthermore, this prediction method can be used for well candidate selection means.",Scientific Contribution Oil and Gas,http://journal.lemigas.esdm.go.id/index.php/SCOG,Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/450,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/40"">Chemical Engineering, Chemistry &amp; Bioengineering</a>"

Landslide Susceptibility Mapping using Machine Learning Algorithm,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Feb 2022,"Landslides are natural disasters that have resulted in the loss of economies and lives over the years. The landslides caused by the 2005 Muzaffarabad earthquake heavily impacted the area, and slopes in the region have become unstable. This research was carried out to find out which areas, as in Muzaffarabad district, are sensitive to landslides and to define the relationship between landslides and geo-environmental factors using three tree-based classifiers, namely, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). These machine learning models are innovative and can assess environmental problems and hazards for any given area on a regional scale. The research consists of three steps: Firstly, for training and validation, 94 historical landslides were randomly split into a proportion of 7/3. Secondly, topographical and geological data as well as satellite imagery were gathered, analyzed, and built into a spatial database using GIS Environment. Nine layers of landslide-conditioning factors were developed, including Aspect, Elevation, Slope, NDVI, Curvature, SPI, TWI, Lithology, and Landcover. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) value were used to estimate the model's efficiency. The area under the curve values for the RF, XGBoost, and KNN models are 0.895 (89.5%), 0.893 (89.3%), and 0.790 (79.0%), respectively. Based on the three machine learning techniques, the innovative outputs show that the performance of the Random Forest model has a maximum AUC value of 0.895, and it is more efficient than the other tree-based classifiers. Elevation and Slope were determined as the most important factors affecting landslides in this research area. The landslide susceptibility maps were classified into four classes: low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility. The result maps are useful for future generalized construction operations, such as selecting and conserving new urban and infrastructural areas. Doi: 10.28991/CEJ-2022-08-02-02 Full Text: PDF",Civil Engineering Journal,http://civilejournal.org/index.php/cej,C.E.J Publishing Group,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/823,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/50"">Civil Engineering, Building, Construction &amp; Architecture</a>"

Predictive and probabilistic modelling using machine learning for building indoor climate control,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Jun 2022,"For the last few decades, thermal comfort has been considered an aspect of sustainable building evaluation methods and tools. However, estimating the indoor air temperature of buildings is a complicated task due to the nonlinear behaviour of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems combined with complex dynamics characterized by the time-varying environment with disturbances. This issue can be alleviated by modelling the building dynamics using Gaussian processes since it also measures the uncertainty bounds. The main focus of this paper is designing a predictive and probabilistic room temperature model of buildings using Gaussian processes and incorporating it into model predictive control to minimize energy consumption and provide thermal comfort satisfaction. We exploited the Gaussian processes’ full probabilistic capabilities as the mean prediction for the room temperature model and used the model uncertainty in the objective function not to lose the desired performance and to design a robust control scheme.

ROP Prediction with Supervised Machine Learning; a Case Study : Supervised Machine Learning,Article InfoPublish Date 08 Apr 2022,"Optimum drilling penetration rate, known as the rate of penetration (ROP) has played a big role in drilling operations. Planning the well ROP always becomes a challenge for drilling engineers to calculate the drilling time needed for the section. Optimum ROP is achieved when the time to drill the section is as planned. Many empirical approaches were develop to model the ROP based on the drilling parameters, and might not always match the actual ROP. In some cases, the actual ROP was slower than planned, which may increase the drilling cost, which needs to be avoided. Hence, some approaches using artificial intelligence (AI), and supervised machine learning have been develop to overcome it. Supervised machine learning is used to developed a ROP model and ROP prediction for one of the development fields, based only on two wells drilling parameters data.

One of the activities that can utilize land and resources in urban areas is urban farming. One example is the Sungkai Green Park Ecotourism in Nagari Lambung Bukit, Pauh Padang District, which has various types of plants that are very useful. However, due to the many and varied plants, farmers experience difficulties in terms of plant maintenance. Therefore, this journal aims to classify weeds and plants, in order to facilitate farmers in plant care. The method that will be applied uses machine learning with image processing to separate weeds and plants which can reduce manual work visually. Image analysis accurately detects areas of identified weeds. Each image has a different pattern and spatial distribution and can be detected using the GLCM technique. This technique represents the relationship between two conflicting pixels in the image. Overall, the image is taken using a webcam which is positioned vertically against the sample plant at low brightness conditions so that it can be processed accurately in machine learning. This GLCM feature is able to extract images to separate weeds and plants by using a texture matrix from the image. The output of the matrix in the form of parameters mean, skewness, kurtosis, entropy, contrast, and energy. These parameters are used to obtain a value for plants so that weeds can be distinguished from plants.

An Empirical Evaluation On Comparative Machine Learning Techniques For Detection of The Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks,Article InfoPublish Date 17 May 2020,"The advent of the Internet that aided the efficient sharing of resources. Also, it has introduced adversaries whom are today restlessly in their continued efforts at an effective, non-detectable means to invade secure systems, either for fun or personal gains. They achieve these feats via the use of malware, which is both on the rise, wreaks havoc alongside causing loads of financial losses to users. With the upsurge to counter these escapades, users and businesses today seek means to detect these evolving behavior and pattern by these adversaries. It is also to worthy of note that adversaries have also evolved, changing their own structure to make signature detection somewhat unreliable and anomaly detection tedious to network administrators. Our study investigates the detection of the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks using machine learning techniques. Results shows that though evolutionary models have been successfully implemented in the detection DDoS, the search for optima is an inconclusive and continuous task. That no one method yields a better optima than hybrids. That with hybrids, users must adequately resolve the issues of data conflicts arising from the dataset to be used, conflict from the adapted statistical methods arising from data encoding, and conflicts in parameter selection to avoid model overtraining, over-fitting and over-parameterization.","Journal of Applied Science, Engineering, Technology, and Education",http://jurnal.ahmar.id/index.php/asci,Yayasan Ahmar Cendekia Indonesia,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/1903,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/50"">Civil Engineering, Building, Construction &amp; Architecture</a>"

"Associated Patterns and Predicting Model of Life Trauma, Depression, and Suicide Using Ensemble Machine Learning",Article InfoPublish Date 29 May 2022,"This study aimed to find associated patterns by association rule mining and propose a prediction model using ensemble learning methods of high levels of trauma items affecting depression and suicide among primary school students in Thai rural extended opportunity schools. Our proposed methods were different from others that have analysed the relationship of high life trauma leading to depression and suicide by using statistical analysis. We found strongly associated patterns and effects among primary students’ trauma, depression, and suicide. The trauma of psychological abuse and neglect may result in suicide, whereas psychological abuse, neglect, and the experience of self-harm are also likely to result in the increased severity of traumatic events in life. The trauma of physical and sexual abuse, neglect, helplessness, feeling worthless, being weak, and self-harm were associated with depression. Our research discovered new knowledge that the risk of suicide arises from two extreme types of trauma: when children’s safety is frequently threatened and the family communicates frequently using rude or abusive words; these traumas may not merely correlate with depression but may ultimately result in suicide. Moreover, this study discovered 7 highly important trauma items and 4 suicide items for predicting depression and suicide using the Random Forest technique. We found that the Random Forest technique performed well in predicting depression and suicide. The predicted depression results show that the overall accuracy was 85.84%, precision was 89.33%, and recall was 75.28%. The predicted suicide results show that the overall accuracy was 91.28%, precision was 89.05%, and recall was 84.72%.

The use of communication for customer service portals in various e-commerce platforms and crime investigations based on digital evidence is increasing the need for sentiment analysis of a conversation. Other languages, such as English, have well-developed libraries and resources for natural language processing, yet there are few studies conducted on Bangla. It is more challenging to extract sentiments from Bangla conversational data due to the language's grammatical complexity. As a result, it opens vast study opportunities. So, support vector machine, multinomial naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest was used. From the dataset, extracted information was labeled as positive and negative.",International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering,http://ijece.iaescore.com/index.php/IJECE,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"
Modified SEIR and machine learning prediction of the trend of the epidemic of COVID-19 in Jordan under lockdowns impact,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Oct 2022,"Susceptible exposed infectious recovered (SEIR) is a fitting model for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread prediction. Hence, to examine the effect of different levels of social distancing on the spreading of the disease, a variable was introduced in the SEIR equations system used in this work. We also used an artificial intelligence approach using a machine learning (ML) method known as deep neural network. This modified SEIR model was applied on the available initial spread data until June 25th, 2021 for the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Without lockdown in Jordan, the analysis demonstrates potential infection to roughly 3.1 million people during the peak of spread approximately 3 months, starting from the date of lockdown (March 21st). Conversely, the present partial lockdowns strategy by the Kingdom was expected to reduce the predicted number of infections to 0.5 million in 9 months period. The analysis also demonstrates the ability of stricter lockdowns to effectively flatten the graph curve of COVID-19 in Jordan. Our modified SEIR and deep neural network (DNN) model were efficient in the prediction of COVID-19 epidemic sizes and peaks.

Machine learning based chroma phase offset detection and correction in motion video,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Dec 2022,"Generally, chroma phase or hue offset issues within a scene are hard to detect, without a reference or context (i.e. some apriori knowledge about how certain objects within the scene should actually appear in terms of their hue). Moreover, when it comes to skin/flesh tones, hue deviation can be noticeable and can markedly degrade the viewer quality of experience(QoE), whenever it does occur. However a lot of research has gone into flesh tone detection, specifically, the color gamut within which flesh tone is present. This topic has been well documented in the literature with respect to various color spaces: red, green, blue (RGB) and YIQ. Therefore, overall issues with chroma offset or hue within the video content could potentially be approached by extracting and analyzing a reliable reference, such as skin or flesh tone (if present), within some allowable deviation. This involves machine learning (ML) based facial recognition and tracking followed by skin tone region recognition within the detected facial sequence (i.e. Region of Interest). The skin region serves as a ‘self-reference’ in order to discern any inherent phase offset within the content. Finally, the angular chroma deviation discerned can then be used for subsequent correction as well. ",IAES International Journal of Artificial Intelligence (IJ-AI),http://ijai.iaescore.com/index.php/IJAI,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"
Machine learning of tax avoidance detection based on hybrid metaheuristics algorithms,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Sep 2022,"This paper addresses the performances of machine learning classification models for the detection of tax avoidance problems. The machine learning models employed automated features selection with hybrid two metaheuristics algorithms namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA). Dealing with a real dataset on the tax avoidance cases among companies in Malaysia, has created a stumbling block for the conventional machine learning models to achieve higher accuracy in the detection process as the associations among all of the features in the datasets are extremely low. This paper presents a hybrid meta-heuristic between PSO and adaptive GA operators for the optimization of features selection in the machine learning models. The hybrid PSO-GA has been designed to employ three adaptive GA operators hence three groups of features selection will be generated. The three groups of features selection were used in random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and support vector machine (SVM).

Data Fairness Transmission and Adaptive Duty Cycle through Machine Learning in wireless Sensor Networks,Article InfoPublish Date 30 Jun 2022,"In this paper, we propose the data fairness transmission and adaptive duty cycle through machine learning in wireless sensor networks. The mechanism of this paper is mainly composed of two parts. The proposed mechanism is based on the sleep-wake structure, which is one of the methods to increase the lifespan of the entire network by efficiently using the energy of the nodes. The first is a mechanism to support priority and data fairness. To this end, data input to the node is divided into priority classes according to transmission urgency and stored. Introduces the concept of cross-layer to rearrange data destined for the same destination. In addition, we propose a fair data transmission mechanism that allows even low-priority data to participate in transmission after a certain period.

An Intrusion Detection System Using SDAE to Enhance Dimensional Reduction in Machine Learning,Article InfoPublish Date 30 Jun 2022,"In the last decade, the number of attacks on the internet has grown significantly, and the types of attacks vary widely. This causes huge financial losses in various institutions such as the private and government sectors. One of the efforts to deal with this problem is by early detection of attacks, often called IDS (instruction detection system). The intrusion detection system was deactivated. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a hardware or software mechanism that monitors the Internet for malicious attacks. It can scan the internetwork for potentially dangerous behavior or security threats. IDS is responsible for maintaining network activity under the Network-Based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) or Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS). IDS works by comparing known normal network activity signatures with attack activity signatures. In this research, a dimensional reduction and feature selection mechanism called Stack Denoising Auto Encoder (SDAE) succeeded in increasing the effectiveness of Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, and SVM. The researchers evaluated the performance using evaluation metrics with a confusion matrix, accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Compared with the results of previous works in the IDS field, our model increased the effectiveness to more than 2% in NSL-KDD Dataset, including in binary class and multi-class evaluation methods. Moreover, using SDAE also improved traditional machine learning with modern deep learning such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Comparing Five Machine Learning-Based Regression Models for Predicting the Study Period of Mathematics Students at IPB University,Article InfoPublish Date 16 Jul 2022,"Grade point average (GPA) is initial information for supervisors to characterize their supervised students. One model that can be used to predict a student's study period based on GPA is a machine learning-based regression model so that supervisors can apply the right strategy for their students. Therefore, this study aims to implement and select a machine learning-based regression model to predict a student's study period based on GPA in semesters 1-6. Several regression models used are least-square regression, ridge regression, Huber regression, quantile regression, and quantile regression with l_2-regularization provided by Machine Learning in Julia (MLJ). The model is evaluated and selected based on several criteria such as maximum error, RMSE, and MAPE. The results showed that the least-square regression model gave the worst evaluation results, although the calculation method was easy and fast. Meanwhile, the quantile regression model provided the best evaluation results. The quantile regression model without regularization gives the smallest RMSE (2.31 months) and MAPE (3.56%), while the quantile regression model with l_2-regularization has a better maximum error (4.9 months). The resulting model can be used by supervisors to predict the study period of their supervised students so that supervisors can characterize their students and can design appropriate strategies.

Machine Learning Used Car Price Prediction with Random Forest Regressor Model,Article InfoPublish Date 02 Jun 2022,"The pandemic has stopped all activities, including the decline in the level of the world economy, this will reduce people's purchasing power. For those who want to buy a car, a used car can be the second option. In some used car sales showrooms, the main task is to determine price predictions based on historical data during previous transactions. The determinants of car prices are heavily influenced by several attributes in the car, for example: type of fuel, for example, km traveled and so on, this is what causes the price prediction process to take a long time. One of the roles in Macine Learning is being able to learn from previous transaction data and this will be a model that can be used to provide used car price predictions. Car price prediction is included in regression, which is looking for a strong relationship from the influence of variable X (predictor) to variable Y (target). In the prediction, of course, the reality data will not be right with the predicted data, for that in the measurement the model will look for the lowest error rate. The experimental results on the test data using the Random Forest Regressor model resulted in MAE = 1.006 and RMSE = 1.452 while the coefficient of determinant R2 = 0.89. And in the previous study with KNN [18], it produced an error rate of MAE = 2.01 and RMSE = 4.01 and the coefficient of determinant R2 = 0.85. While the comparison model uses Linear Regression, Ridge, Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting. Not all Machine Learning models are suitable for all data, for that it is necessary to choose the right machine learning model by experimenting with several models. And the lowest error level (MAE and RMSE) will be determined. The error values ​​for MAE and RMSE which are close to zero are close to the predicted value close to the actual value. On the other hand, if the error rate is very high, the prediction value is very far from the actual value.","JISICOM (Journal of Information System, Infomatics and Computing)",http://journal.stmikjayakarta.ac.id/index.php/jisicom,Sekolah Tinggi Manajemen Informatika dan Komputer Jayakarta,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/1345,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"

Penerapan Machine Learning Untuk Mengategorikan Sampah Plastik Rumah Tangga,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Jul 2021,"Plastic waste is the result of human needs for plastic-based products. Due to high needs, the manufacture and use of plastics as raw materials produced do not use plastics as raw materials for their manufacture. Side effects of this phenomenon cause plastic waste to be transferred to the Final Shelter (TPA). Plastic waste is divided into 7 types, some can be replaced, recycled, and reused. To be able to do better sorting and screening of plastic waste, human labor is needed. This causes humans to have the ability to sort and filter visual objects, but humans are less consistent in various influencing factors. However, if this is applied to a computing system, the plastic waste treatment system will provide consistent results. If this system is applied in various layers of waste treatment, the plastic waste that pollutes the environment will be reduced.

Chatbot Designing Information Service for New Student Registration Based on AIML and Machine Learning,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Oct 2020,"One of the efforts made by universities to serve prospective students is by providing consulting services and information that is usually carried out directly at the booth provided, through phone service or live chat support available on the college website. Increased visitors will result in waiting times due to limited availability of officers, which results in decreased satisfaction of prospective new students, moreover this service is only available during campus operating hours. One alternative solution to overcome this problem is to use Chatbot, able to answer questions raised by prospective new students which can be categorized as Frequently Asked Questions abbreviated as FAQ. Chatbot technology can be developed with a variety of AI (Artificial Intelligence) techniques. One of them is the AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) technique. One of the main drawbacks of AIML is that there is no reasoning ability so a learning system that is focused on supervised learning is needed. In the chatbot that will be built the learning process uses a selective neural conversational model or commonly called the Deep Semantic Similarity Model (DSSM) developed by Microsoft. Meanwhile, the measurement of chatbot performance will be done using Confusion Matrix which is a method of evaluating the performance of the algorithm from Machine Learning (ML).

Protein Annotation of Breast-cancer-related Proteins with Machine-learning Tools,Article InfoPublish Date 26 Jun 2020,"One of the primary contributors to the mortality of women is breast cancer. Several approaches are used to cure it, but recurrence occurs in 79% of the cases because the underlying mechanism of the protein molecules is not carefully ex-amined. The goal of this research was to use machine-learning tools is to elucidate conserved regions and to obtain functional annotations of breast-cancer-related proteins. The sequences of five breast-cancer-related proteins (BRCA2, BCAR1, BCAR3, BCAR4, and BRMS1) and their annotations were retrieved from the UniProt and TCGA databases, respectively. Conserved regions were extracted using CLUSTALX. We constructed a phylogenetic tree using the MEGA 7.0. SUPERFAMILY database to obtain fine-grained domain annotation. The tree revealed that the BRCA2 and BCAR4 protein sequences are located in a clade, which indicates that they have overlapping functions. Several protein domains were identified, including the SH2 and Ras GEF domains in BCAR3, the SH3 domain in BCAR1, and the BRCA2 helical domain, the nucleic-acid-binding protein, and tower domain. We found that no protein domains could be annotated for BCAR4 or BRMS1, which may indicate the presence of a disordered protein state. We suggest that each protein has distinct functionalities that are complementary in regulating the progression of breast cancer, although further study is necessary for confirmation. This protein-domain annotation project could be leveraged by the complete integration of mapping with respect to gene and disease ontology. This type of leverage is vital for obtaining biochemical insights regarding breast cancer.",Makara Journal of Science,https://scholarhub.ui.ac.id/science,Universitas Indonesia,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/36,

Detection of Bundle Branch Blocks using Machine Learning Techniques,Article InfoPublish Date 06 Sep 2022,"The most effective method used for the diagnosis of heart diseases is the Electrocardiogram (ECG). The shape of the ECG signal and the time interval between its various components gives useful details about any underlying heart disease. Any dysfunction of the heart is called as cardiac arrhythmia. The electrical impulses of the heart are blocked due to the cardiac arrhythmia called Bundle Branch Block (BBB) which can be observed as an irregular ECG wave. The BBB beats can indicate serious heart disease. The precise and quick detection of cardiac arrhythmias from the ECG signal can save lives and can also reduce the diagnostics cost. This study presents a machine learning technique for the automatic detection of BBB. In this method both morphological and statistical features were calculated from the ECG signals available in the standard MIT BIH database to classify them as normal, Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB) and Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB). ECG records in the MIT- BIH arrhythmia database containing Normal sinus rhythm, RBBB, and LBBB were used in the study. The suitability of the features extracted was evaluated using three classifiers, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbours and linear discriminant analysis. The accuracy of the technique is highly promising for all the three classifiers with k-nearest neighbours giving the highest accuracy of 98.2%. Since the ECG waveforms of patients with the same cardiac disorder is similar in shape, the proposed method is subject independent. The proposed technique is thus a reliable and simple method involving less computational complexity for the automatic detection of bundle branch block. This system can reduce the effort of cardiologists thereby enabling them to concentrate more on treatment of the patients.",Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Informatics (IJEEI),http://section.iaesonline.com/index.php/IJEEI,IAES Indonesia Section and Partners,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/65,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"

Pada tahun 2018, hasil produksi pala sebesar 1.750 ton dengan luas lahan perkebunan pala di kabupaten fakfak sebesar 17.542 Ha yang tersebar di seluruh distrik kecuali distrik Karas, distrik Tomage dan distrik Bomberay. Jika ditinjau dari segi jumlah populasi pohon pala, jumlah tanaman pala di kabupaten fakfak tidak mengalami peningkatan signifikan setiap tahunnya. Hal ini desebabkan karena banyaknya tanaman pala yang mati saat dipindahkan ke kebun serta teknik pembibitan petani masih bersifat manual. Selain itu, juga dipengaruhi oleh kondisi cuaca yang tidak menentu sehingga mempengaruhi kelembapan tanah dan menghambat pertumbuhan tanaman tersebut. Saat musim kemarau, para petani biasanya menyiram tanaman bibit pala secara manual. Hal ini menjadi kendala petani saat mereka melakukan pembibitan sebanyak ribuan pohon. Mereka harus menyiram satu persatu pohon tersebut untuk memastikan bahwa kebutuhan pasokan air dan kelembaban tanah pada bibit tanaman pala tetap terjaga. Berangkat dari permasalahan tersebut, dibutuhkan sebuah metode yang mampu melakukan automasi sistem irigasi yang dapat menjaga kebutuhan nutrisi tanah dan mengurangi tingkat kematian pohon pala akibat cuaca. Penelitian ini berfokus pada perancangan sistem irigasi cerdas berbasis Internet Of Things (IoT) dengan mengkombinasikan beberapa sensor untuk mengukur suhu tanah dan suhu udara disekitar tanaman pala.

A Comparative Study for Time-to-Event Analysis and Survival Prediction for Heart Failure Condition using Machine Learning Techniques,Article InfoPublish Date 25 Jul 2022,"Heart Failure, an ailment in which the heart isn’t functioning as effectively as it should, causing in an insufficient cardiac output. The effectual functioning of the human body is dependent on how well the heart is able to pump oxygenated, and nutrient rich blood to the tissues and cells. Heart failure falls into the category of cardiovascular diseases - the disorders of the heart and blood vessels. One of the leading causes of global deaths resulting in an estimated 17.9 million deaths globally every year. The condition of heart failure results out of structural changes to the cardiac muscles majorly in the left ventricle. The weakened muscles cause the ventricle to lose its ability to contract completely. Since the left ventricle generates the required pressure for blood circulation, any kind of a failure condition results in the reduction of cardiac power output. This study aims to conduct a thorough survival analysis and survival prediction on the data of 299 patients classified into the class III/IV of heart failure and diagnosed with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Survival analysis involves the study of the effect of a mediation assessed by measuring the number of subjects survived after that mediation over a period of time. The time starting from a distinct point to the occurrence of a certain event, for example death is known as survival time and the corresponding analysis is known as survival analysis. The analysis was performed using the methods of Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates and Cox Potential Hazard regression. KM plots showed the survival estimates as a function of each clinical feature and how each feature at various levels affect survival over the period of time. Cox regression modelled the hazard of death event around the clinical features used for the study. As a result of the analysis, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, time and age were identified as highly significant and major risk factors in the advanced stages of heart failure. Age and rise in level of serum creatinine have a deleterious effect on the survival chances. Ejection Fraction has a beneficial effect on survival and with a unit increase in the in the EF level the probability of death event decreases by ~5.2%. Higher rate of mortality is observed during the initial days post diagnosis and the hazard gradually decreases if patients have lived for a certain number of days. Hypertension and anemic condition also seem to be high risk factors. Machine learning classification models for survival prediction were built using the most significant variables found from survival analysis. SVM, decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM algorithm were implemented, and all the models seem to perform well enough. However, the availability of more data will make the models more stable and robust. Smart solutions, like this can reduce the risk of heart failure condition by providing accurate prognosis, survival projections, and risk predictions. Technology and data can combine together to address any disparities in treatment, design better care plan, and improve patient health outcomes. Smart health AI solutions would enhance healthcare policies, enable physicians to look beyond the conventional practices, and increase the patient satisfaction levels not only in case of heart failure conditions but healthcare in general.","Journal of Electronics, Electromedical Engineering, and Medical Informatics",http://jeeemi.org/index.php/jeeemi, Polilteknik Kesehatan Kemenkes Surabaya,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/1306,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"

Rekayasa Fitur Berbasis Machine Learning untuk Mendeteksi Serangan DDoS,Article InfoPublish Date 24 Aug 2022,"Distributed network attacks, also known as distributed denial of service (DDoS) are a major threat and problem for internet security. DDoS is an attack on a network aiming to disable server resources. These attacks increase every year with the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic. One of countermeasures to minimize the DDoS impact is the intrusion detection system (IDS) command. IDS techniques are currently still employing traditional methods so that they have many limitations compared to techniques and tools used by attackers because traditional IDS methods only use signature-based detection or anomaly-based detection models which cause many errors. Network data packet traffic has a complex nature, both in terms of sizes and sources. This research utilized the ability of artificial neural network (ANN) to detect normal attacks or DDoS. A classification technique with ANN method is a solution to these issues. Based on the shortcomings of the traditional IDS, this study aims to detect DDoS attacks using feeder machine learning-based feature engineering techniques to improve the IDS development. Using the UNSW-NB15 dataset with the ANN method, this study also aims to analyze and obtain training function combinations and the best hidden layer architectures of ANNs to solve the detection and classification problems of DDoS packets in computer networks. As a result, the training function combinations and hidden layer architectures of the ANN can provide a high level of DDoS recognition accuracy. Based on experiments conducted with three schemes and an ANN schema architecture technique with eight features as input, the highest accuracy was 98.22%.

Mix histogram and gray level co-occurrence matrix to improve glaucoma prediction machine learning,Article InfoPublish Date 06 Jan 2023,"Glaucoma is an eye disease that is the second leading cause of blindness. Examination of glaucoma by an ophthalmologist is usually done by observing the retinal image directly. Observations from one doctor to another may differ, depending on their educational background, experience, and psychological condition. Therefore, a glaucoma detection system based on digital image processing is needed. The detection or classification of glaucoma with digital image processing is strongly influenced by the feature extraction method, feature selection, and the type of features used. Many researchers have carried out various kinds of feature extraction for glaucoma detection systems whose accuracy needs to be improved. In general, there are two groups of features, namely morphological features and non-morphological features (image-based features). In this study, it is proposed to detect glaucoma using texture features, namely the GLCM feature extraction method, histograms, and the combined GLCM-histogram extraction method. The GLCM method uses 5 features and the Histogram uses 6 features. To distinguish between glaucoma and non-glaucoma eyes, the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network model serves as a classifier. The data used in this study consisted of 136 fundus images (66 normal images and 70 images affected by glaucoma). The performance obtained with this approach is an accuracy of 93.4%, a sensitivity of 86.6%, and a specificity of 100%.",Journal of Soft Computing Exploration,https://shmpublisher.com/index.php/joscex,shm publisher,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/2425,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"

"Liver fibrosis processing, multiclassification, and diagnosis based on hybrid machine learning approaches",Article InfoPublish Date 01 Mar 2023,"The cirrhosis and cirrhosis-related problems are connected to the degree of fibrosis in the liver. The purpose of this paper is to propose an automated method for identifying liver fibrosis using ultrasound shear wave elastography (700) images that is based on a hybrid machine learning approach using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with two types of classifier (SoftMax and support vector machine (SVM)). The dataset gathered from hospitals is used in the training and testing phases of the model. The objective is to develop a hybrid machine learning model that can classify images based on their stage of fibrosis. The suggested system comprises three stages. The first is the preprocessing step, which starts with countor detection and continues with the ""contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)"" technique to show the properties of liver tissue. In the second step, the CNN algorithm was utilized, which was based on several images to extract deep features and identify shear wave elastography (SWE) samples. In the third step, SVM and SoftMax functions are used to classify liver fibrosis. A five-class model (normal, F1, F2, F3, and F4) was developed. The result illustrates how successfully the CNN-SoftMax and CNN-SVM classifiers classified liver fibrosis in the test dataset, with 97.18% and 98.59% accuracy, respectively.",Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,http://ijeecs.iaescore.com/index.php/IJEECS,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6,

The need for accurate weather forecasts will be effective and efficient in managing the quality of civilization flexibly. In many cases it is found that the results of weather forecasts in the same city differ depending on the radius. This of course requires a precise and accurate algorithm to determine it. The algorithm used is based on machine learning type of artificial neural network which compares backpropagation and bayessian regularization. The results obtained show that bayessian regularization outperforms backpropagation with the smallest MSE and the highest accuracy and the shortest computation time to determine sunny, cloudy, light rain and heavy rain forecasts. The unbalanced distribution of data causes fluctuations in the MSE calculation and accuracy. The addition of training will improve system performance which is indicated by a significant increase in accuracy.

Classification of arecanut using machine learning techniques,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Apr 2023,"In agricultural domain research, image processing and machine learning techniques play an important role. This paper provides a unique solution for classifying the good and defective arecanuts based on their color, texture, and density value. In the market different varieties of arecanut are available. Usually, qualitative sorting is done manually, and this can be replaced by applying machine vision techniques to grade the arecanut. Classification of arecanut based on quality is done using various machine learning techniques and it is observed that artificial neural networks give good results compared to other classifiers like logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes classifiers, and support vector machine. A unique density feature is considered here for better classification. The result of classifiers without considering the density feature is compared with respect to the density feature and it is observed that artificial neural networks work better than the others. The proposed method works effectively for classifying arecanut with an accuracy of 98.8%.",International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering,http://ijece.iaescore.com/index.php/IJECE,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/6,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"
Predicting reaction based on customer's transaction using machine learning approaches,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Feb 2023,"Banking advertisements are important because they help target specific customers on subscribing to their packages or other deals by giving their current customers more fixed-term deposit offers. This is done through promotional advertisements on the Internet or media pages, and this task is the responsibility of the shopping department. In order to build a relationship with them, offer them the best deals, and be appropriate for the client with the company's assurance to recover these deposits, many banks or telecommunications firms store the data of their customers. The Portuguese bank increases its sales by establishing a relationship with its customers. This study proposes creating a prediction model using machine learning algorithms, to see how the customer reacts to subscribe to those fixed-term deposits or offers made with the aid of their past record. This classification is binary, i.e., the prediction of whether or not a customer will embrace these offers.

COMPARISON OF MACHINE LEARNING MODELS FOR LAND COVER CLASSIFICATION,Article InfoPublish Date 21 Nov 2022,"Land cover data remain one of crucial information for public use. Â With rapid human-associated land alteration, this information needs to be frequently updated. Remotely-sensed data provide the best option to construct land cover maps with numerous methods available in the literature. While disagreement exists to select the robust one, further exploration should be made to extend the understanding on the behavior of machine learners, in particular, for classification problems. This article discusses performance of pixel-based machine learning algorithms, frequently used in research or implementation. Five popular algorithms were evaluated to distinguish five rural land cover classes, i.e. built-ups, crops, mixed garden, oil palm plantations and rubber estates, from Sentinel-2 data. This research found that the benchmark, classification and regression tree, was unable to differentiate woody vegetation, although the overall accuracy was sufficiently moderate. This suggested that overall accuracy cannot be seen as the only measure for assessing the quality of the thematic output. Meanwhile, support vector machines and random forest competed to yield the highest accuracy and class detection capability, although the latter was in favor with 98% accuracy level. A newly developed model, like extreme gradient boosting, achieved a similar level of accuracy.

Comparative analysis of resampling techniques on Machine Learning algorithm,Article InfoPublish Date 01 May 2022,"Generally, classification algorithms in the field of data science assume that the classes of training data are equally distributed. However, datasets on real problems often have an unbalanced class distribution. Unbalanced dataset classes make up the majority class and the minority class. In general, minority classes are more attractive and more important to identify. In this case, the correct classification for the minority class sample is more valuable than the majority class. The unbalanced class distribution causes the classification algorithm to have difficulty in classifying minority class samples correctly. If the performance of the algorithm model is good for the majority class sample but bad for the minority class then this imbalance problem is a crucial thing to be addressed. Many solutions are offered for this problem, namely by oversampling techniques in the minority class and/or undersampling techniques in the majority class.

Optimal Data Transmission and Improve Efficiency through Machine Learning in Wireless Sensor Networks,Article InfoPublish Date 19 Aug 2022,"Each sensor node in WSN is typically equipped with a limited capacity small battery. Energy-efficient communication is therefore considered a key component of network life extension. In addition, as the utilization of the sensor network increases, duplicate data and abnormal data is also collected to reduce the accuracy of the data in various environments. AI is used to recognize data anomaly values and increase packets' accuracy by removing out-of-range data. This can improve performance through optimal data transmission, resulting in increased network life, energy efficiency, and reliability. This paper proposes a protocol called MLQ-MAC that reflects the above. MLQ-MAC uses AI techniques to consider different types of data packets. The data collected by the sensor removes the measurement anomaly and duplicate data and stores it in a different transmission queue by priority. Efficient data transfer is possible by using an AI Discriminator for accurate classification before being stored on a transmission queue. The AI-Discriminator classifies a variety of factors, including the collection environment, characteristics of network applications, and so on. It also uses two new technologies: self-adaptation and scheduling for efficient transmission. In the protocol, the receiver adjusts the duty cycle according to to transmit urgency to improve network QoS. Finally, the simulation results show that the MLQ-MAC protocol reduces energy consumption at the receiver by up to 3.4% and per bit by up to 2.3% and improves packet delivery accuracy by up to 3%.",JOIV : International Journal on Informatics Visualization,http://joiv.org/index.php/joiv,Politeknik Negeri Padang,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/89,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"

Mathematics and Mother Tongue Academic Achievement: A Machine Learning Approach,Article InfoPublish Date 10 Sep 2022,"Academic achievement is of great interest to education researchers and practitioners. Several academic achievement determinants have been described in the literature, mostly identified by analyzing primary (sample) data with classic statistical methods. Despite their superiority, only recently have machine learning methods started to be applied systematically in this context. However, even when this is the case, the ability to draw conclusions is greatly hampered by the ""black-box"" effect these methods entail. We contribute to the literature by combining the efficiency of machine learning methods, trained with data from virtually every public upper-secondary student of a European country, with the ability to quantify exactly how much each driver impacts academic achievement on Mathematics and mother tongue, through the use of prototypes. Our results indicate that the most important general academic achievement inhibitor is the previous retainment. Legal guardian's education is a critical driver, especially in Mathematics; whereas gender is especially important for mother tongue, as female students perform better. Implications for research and practice are presented. Doi: 10.28991/ESJ-2022-SIED-010 Full Text: PDF",Emerging Science Journal,http://ijournalse.org/index.php/ESJ,Ital Publication,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/683,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/120"">Environmental Science</a>"
Evaluation of Machine Learning Algorithms for Emotions Recognition using Electrocardiogram,Article InfoPublish Date 07 Nov 2022,"In recent studies, researchers have focused on using various modalities to recognize emotions for different applications. A major challenge is identifying emotions correctly with only electrocardiograms (ECG) as the modality. The main objective is to reduce costs by using single-modality ECG signals to predict human emotional states. This paper presents an emotion recognition approach utilizing the heart rate variability features obtained from ECG with feature selection techniques (exhaustive feature selection (EFS) and Pearson’s correlation) to train the classification models. Seven machine learning (ML) models: multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Logistic Regression, Adaboost and Extra Tree classifier are used to classify emotional state. Two public datasets, DREAMER and SWELL are used for evaluation. The results show that no particular ML works best for all data. For DREAMER with EFS, the best models to predict valence, arousal, and dominance are Extra Tree (74.6%), MLP and DT (74.6%), and GBDT and DT (69.8%), respectively. Extra tree with Pearson’s correlation are the best method for the ECG SWELL dataset and provide 100% accuracy. The usage of Extra tree classifier and feature selection technique contributes to the improvement of the model accuracy. Moreover, the Friedman test proved that ET is as good as other classification models for predicting human emotional state and ranks highest. Doi: 10.28991/ESJ-2023-07-01-011 Full Text: PDF",Emerging Science Journal,http://ijournalse.org/index.php/ESJ,Ital Publication,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/683,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/120"">Environmental Science</a>"
A Comparative Performance Analysis of Hybrid and Classical Machine Learning Method in Predicting Diabetes,Article InfoPublish Date 12 Oct 2022,"Diabetes mellitus is one of medical science’s most important research topics because of the disease’s severe consequences. High blood glucose levels characterize it. Early detection of diabetes is made possible by machine learning techniques with their intelligent capabilities to accurately predict diabetes and prevent its complications. Therefore, this study aims to find a machine learning approach that can more accurately predict diabetes. This study compares the performance of various classical machine learning models with the hybrid machine learning approach. The hybrid model includes the homogenous model, which comprises Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, Extra Trees, Gradient Booster, and the heterogeneous model that uses stacking ensemble methods. The stacking ensemble or stacked generalization approach is a meta-classifier in which multiple learners collaborate for prediction. The performance of the homogeneous hybrid models, Stacked Generalization and the classic machine learning methods such as Naive Bayes and Multilayer Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbour, and support vector machine are compared. The experimental analysis using Pima Indians and the early-stage diabetes dataset demonstrates that the hybrid models achieve higher accuracy in diagnosing diabetes than the classical models. In the comparison of all the hybrid models, the heterogeneous model using the Stacked Generalization approach outperformed other models by achieving 83.9% and 98.5%. Doi: 10.28991/ESJ-2023-07-01-08 Full Text: PDF",Emerging Science Journal,http://ijournalse.org/index.php/ESJ,Ital Publication,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/683,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/120"">Environmental Science</a>"

Automatic 3D Cranial Landmark Positioning based on Surface Curvature Feature using Machine Learning,Article InfoPublish Date 07 Jun 2022,"Cranial anthropometric reference points (landmarks) play an important role in craniofacial reconstruction and identification. Knowledge to detect the position of landmarks is critical. This work aims to locate landmarks automatically. Landmarks positioning using Surface Curvature Feature (SCF) is inspired by conventional methods of finding landmarks based on morphometrical features. Each cranial landmark has a unique shape. With the appropriate 3D descriptors, the computer can draw associations between shapes and landmarks using machine learning. The challenge in classification and detection in three-dimensional space is to determine the model and data representation. Using three-dimensional raw data in machine learning is a serious volumetric issue. This work uses the Surface Curvature Feature as a three-dimensional descriptor. It extracts the local surface curvature shape into a projection sequential value (depth). A machine learning method is developed to determine the position of landmarks based on local surface shape characteristics. Classification is carried out from the top-n prediction probabilities for each landmark class, from a set of predictions, then filtered to get pinpoint accuracy. The landmark prediction points are hypothetically clustered in a particular area, so a cluster-based filter is appropriate to isolate them. The learning model successfully detected the landmarks, with the average distance between the prediction points and the ground truth being 0.0326 normalized units. The cluster-based filter is implemented to increase accuracy compared to the ground truth. Thus, SCF is suitable as a 3D descriptor of cranial landmarks.",Knowledge Engineering and Data Science,http://journal2.um.ac.id/index.php/keds,Universitas Negeri Malang,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/16,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"
A Comparison of Machine Learning Models to Prioritise Emails using Emotion Analysis for Customer Service Excellence,Article InfoPublish Date 07 Jun 2022,"There has been little research on machine learning for email prioritization for customer service excellence. To fill this gap, we propose and assess the efficacy of various machine learning techniques for classifying emails into three degrees of priority: high, low, and neutral, based on the emotions inherent in the email content. It is predicted that after emails are classified into those three categories, recipients will be able to respond to emails more efficiently and provide better customer service. We use the NRC Emotion Lexicon to construct a labeled email dataset of 517,401 messages for our proposal. Following that, we train and test four prominent machine learning models, MNB, SVM, LogR, and RF, and an Ensemble of MNB, LSVC, and RF classifiers, on the labeled dataset. Our main findings suggest that machine learning may be used to classify emails based on their emotional content. However, some models outperform others. During the testing phase, we also discovered that the LogR and LSVC models performed the best, with an accuracy of 72%, while the MNB classifier performed the poorest. Furthermore, classification performance differed depending on whether the dataset was balanced or imbalanced. We conclude that machine learning models that employ emotions for email classification are a promising avenue that should be explored further.",Knowledge Engineering and Data Science,http://journal2.um.ac.id/index.php/keds,Universitas Negeri Malang,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/16,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"

Fruits Disease Classification using Machine Learning Techniques,Article InfoPublish Date 31 Dec 2022,"Due to increased population, there is a high demand for agricultural products these days and therefore, effective growth and increased fruit production have become critical. Consequently, for better fruit yield cultivators employ traditional methods for monitoring fruit yield from harvest till ripening of fruit. However, manual monitoring and visual inspection doesn’t always bring the actual identification of fruit disease due to variety of reasons, such as less knowledge about pathogens, requiring more time for disease analysis and that too with less accuracy and so on, consequently, leaving for the need of a professional assistance and expertise. Moreover, the task also becomes difficult as various fruits demonstrate their gesticulation by changing the colour of their skin which can come from nature and resulting in various black or dark brown spots on the fruit skin indicating various diseases. As a result, it is necessary to propose an efficient smart farming strategy that will aid in increased productivity while at the same time involving less human effort. The proposed research work attempts to classify the fruit disease at its early stage by using machine learning techniques. For this purpose, fruit’s texture, and skin colour have been utilized. The approach fundamentally employs three machine learning classifier algorithms - KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Whereas the features have been determined by using three prominent feature extractors - Haralick, Hu Moments and colour histogram. Finally, the system has been evaluated by utilizing the k-fold cross validation method. Specimen dataset was divided into two groups — the training subset and the test subset. As a rule, four-fold cross-validation, three-fourths of the images were used for training the models whereas, the remaining one-fourth were used for testing purposes. Assessment results for suggested methodology after conducting experimentation on publicly available dataset and drawn confusion matrix and learning cure shows that Random Forest classifiers achieves accuracy about 99% while for K-Means accuracy statistics stands at 98.67% and for Decision trees it is about 97.75% - for colour histogram features.",Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Informatics (IJEEI),http://section.iaesonline.com/index.php/IJEEI,IAES Indonesia Section and Partners,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/65,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"

Penelitian menggunakan algoritma Artificial Neural Network dengan metode optimasi kombinasi Adam dan Nesterov Momentum. Pengujian menggunakan skenario 5-fold cross validation. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa kombinasi Adam dan Nesterov Momentum memiliki kinerja lebih baik daripada classical Adam dalam memprediksi kesiapan sekolah dengan akurasi 96% dan loss 0.06 dalam 1.98 seconds pada 10 neuron dan 1000 epochs. AbstractSchool readiness is an aspect of child development that plays a role in the child's ability to adapt in the systematics of elementary level education. Based on the Minister of Education and Culture, 7 years is the right age for children to enter elementary school, because children already have physical and psychological readiness to take part in the formal education process. However, every child does not have the same condition at a certain age. Thus, the Nijmeegse Schoolbekwaamheids Test (NST) is needed to measure school readiness. The NST instrument can only be used by the Psychology Bureau who has the ability to carry out psychological assessments. Meanwhile, teachers and parents who have a role in providing support and stimulation to children cannot use these instrument. Machine learning is a technique that uses algorithms to find useful patterns in data. Based on previous NST data, it can be designed as a school readiness prediction model that will facilitate teachers and parents in knowing the readiness of children to enter elementary school. Research data is administrative data of 225 students who have taken the NST-based school readiness test conducted by TK Ar-Rasyid in 2012-2018. NST administrative data consists of age, gender, child position, number of siblings, pre-elementary status, father education, mother education and school readiness results. Based on the Chi-Square correlation, variables that have a strong significant relationship to school readiness test results are pre-elementary status, number of siblings and age with p<.05. The research used Artificial Neural Network algorithms with a combination of Adam and Nesterov Momentum optimization method. Model testing used a 5-fold cross validation scenario. The results showed that the combination of Adam and Nesterov Momentum performed better than classical Adam in predicting school readiness with 96% accuracy and 0.06 loss in 1.98 seconds on 10 neurons and 1000 epochs.",Jurnal Teknologi Informasi dan Ilmu Komputer,https://jtiik.ub.ac.id/index.php/jtiik,Universitas Brawijaya,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/28,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"
Pengembangan Auto-AI Model Generatif Analisis Kompleksitas Waktu Algoritma Untuk Data Multi-Sensor IoT Pada Node-RED Menggunakan Extreme Learning Machine,Article InfoPublish Date 29 Dec 2022,"Awal mulanya, algoritma hanya dipakai untuk solusi penyelesaian persamaan matematika sederhana, seperti aljabar, aritmatika, probabilitas, dan lainnya yang lebih banyak dikerjakan secara manual dan membutuhkan waktu dan upaya yang cukup tinggi seperti pada kasus penghitungan nilai kompleksitas waktu algoritma dengan model rumus T(n), baik untuk algoritma non-rekursif maupun rekursif. Namun dengan perkembangan teknologi komputer untuk AI, Machine Learning maupun Deep Learning, algoritma dengan basis AI tersebut, dalam penelitian ini dikembangkan untuk menemukan solusi general persamaan model T(n) secara otomatis dari desain algoritma sederhana atau kompleks. Langkah dalam penelitian digunakan pembuatan model generatif berbasis algoritma Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) berdasarkan pencatatan nilai waktu komputasi pada beberapa kali pengujian untuk mengotomasi penentuan model persamaan kompleksitas waktu algoritma secara general baik untuk pencarian best case, worst case maupun average case untuk non-rekursif, dan base case dan recurrent case untuk rekursif, maupun keduanya. Hasil komparasi nilai T(n) dari ELM, yang tercepat atau terkecil waktu komputasinya digunakan sebagai rekomendasi algoritma untuk pengolahan data multi-sensor pada Internet of Things (IoT) simulator maupun non-simulator menggunakan Node-RED dengan tambahan platform yaitu flespi dan Heroku, sebagai solusi general untuk semua jenis kasus dan analisis algoritmanya. Berdasarkan pengujian didapatkan selisih nilai antara data aktual dengan hasil prediksi dalam ukuran nilai rata-rata MAPE sebesar 11,90%, yang menunjukkan nilai kesalahan yang cukup kecil. AbstractInitially, algorithms were only used for solving simple mathematical equations such as algebra, arithmetic, probability, and others that were mostly carried out manually and required quite a lot of time and effort as in the case of calculating the value of the time complexity of the algorithm with the formula model of T(n), both for non-recursive and recursive algorithms. However, with the development of computer technology for AI, both Machine Learning and Deep Learning, the AI-based algorithms in this study were developed to identify general solutions to the T(n) model equation automatically from simple or complex algorithm designs. The steps in the study are utilized to create a generative model based on the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm according to the recording of computational time values on several tests to automate the determination of time complexity equation model of the algorithm in general including the search of best cases, worst cases, and average cases for non-recursive, and base cases and recurrent cases for recursive, as well as algorithms that contain both. The results of the comparison of T(n) values from ELM revealed that the fastest or smallest computational time is used as the algorithm recommendations for multi-sensor data processing in the Internet of Things (IoT) simulators and non-simulators by utilizing Node-RED with additional platforms i.e., flespi and Heroku, as a general solution for the entire types of cases and analysis of their algorithms.

Perbandingan Metode Supervised Machine Learning untuk Prediksi Prevalensi Stunting di Provinsi Jawa Timur,Article InfoPublish Date 29 Dec 2022,"Stunting atau kasus balita kerdil/pendek adalah salah satu masalah di bidang kesehatan yang saat ini sedang dihadapi oleh masyarakat Indonesia. Provinsi Jawa Timur memiliki nilai prevalensi stunting sebesar 26,8% berdasarkan integrasi data Kementerian Kesehatan dan Badan Pusat Statistik. Nilai tersebut masih tergolong tinggi karena standar minimal yang ditetapkan oleh World Health Organization (WHO) adalah sebesar 20%. Oleh karena itu, penelitian ini bertujuan untuk memberikan kontribusi dalam penyelesaian permasalahan stunting di Provinsi Jawa Timur dengan cara menganalisis faktor-faktor yang diprediksi bisa memengaruhi tingkat prevalensi stunting berdasarkan data sekunder hasil survei dari beberapa lembaga resmi dan terpercaya di bidang kesehatan yang telah dipublikasikan. Supervised machine learning merupakan pendekatan dalam pembuatan kecerdasan buatan (artificial intelligence) yang menggunakan data-data berlabel sebagai data latihnya. Pendekatan ini dirasa sangat sesuai digunakan dalam prediksi nilai prevalensi stunting pada suatu wilayah berdasarkan data-data lain yang relevan.  Penelitian-penelitian sebelumnya tentang prediksi prevalensi stunting rata-rata hanya menggunakan salah satu metode supervised machine learning saja dan data sekunder yang digunakan hanya bersumber dari salah satu sumber survei saja. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa faktor-faktor penyebab yang memiliki korelasi tinggi terhadap nilai prevalensi stunting bukan hanya Berat Badan Lahir Rendah (BBLR) saja, namun juga Indeks Pembangunan Manusia, sanitasi, dan Indeks Penduduk Miskin.

East Java Province has a stunting prevalence value of 26.8% based on data integration from the Ministry of Health and the Central Statistics Agency. This value is still relatively high because the minimum standard set by the World Health Organization (WHO) is 20%. Therefore, this study aims to contribute to solving the stunting problem in East Java Province by analyzing the factors that are predicted to affect the stunting prevalence rate based on published secondary data from surveys from several official and trusted institutions in the health sector. Supervised machine learning is an approach in making artificial intelligence that uses labeled data as training data. This approach is considered very suitable to be used in predicting the value of stunting prevalence in an area based on other relevant data. Previous studies on predicting the prevalence of stunting on average only used one supervised machine learning method and the secondary data used was only sourced from one survey source. The results showed that the causative factors that have a high correlation to the prevalence of stunting are not only low birth weight (BBLR), but also the Human Development Index, sanitation, and the Poor Population Index. In addition, several methods in supervised machine learning are also compared, namely, linear regression, support vector regression, and random forest regression. The support vector regression method in this study has a lower error value, namely 0.91 for MAE and 1.30 for MSE.",Jurnal Teknologi Informasi dan Ilmu Komputer,https://jtiik.ub.ac.id/index.php/jtiik,Universitas Brawijaya,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/28,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"

Klasifikasi Aktivitas Manusia Menggunakan Algoritme Computed Input Weight Extreme Learning Machine dengan Reduksi Dimensi Principal Component Analysis,Article InfoPublish Date 22 Dec 2022,"Salah satu bidang penelitian yang sangat penting yaitu pengenalan aktivitas manusia secara otomatis dikarenakan potensi penerapannya di berbagai bidang lain seperti pengawasan, lingkungan cerdas, maupun kesehatan. Dari berbagai pendekatan yang pernah dilakukan untuk mengenali aktivitas manusia, teknik berbasis sensor diketahui lebih unggul daripada teknik lain seperti teknik berbasis visi komputer. Teknik berbasis sensor juga dapat dilakukan menggunakan ponsel cerdas, namun penggunaan ponsel cerdas memiliki kekurangan dalam melakukan komputasi algoritme yang kompleks. Apalagi, data hasil ekstraksi fitur dari sinyal yang ditangkap oleh sensor memiliki dimensi yang tinggi. Sehingga, diperlukan sebuah metode untuk mengurangi dimensi fitur dari data, serta melakukan klasifikasi terhadap data tersebut dengan cepat dan tepat. Salah satu metode yang dapat digunakan untuk mengurangi dimensi fitur dari sebuah data adalah Principal Component Analysis (PCA), dan salah satu metode klasifikasi yang dapat digunakan adalah Computed Input Weight Extreme Learning Machine (CIW-ELM). Oleh karena itu, penelitian ini akan menggunakan kedua metode tersebut untuk melakukan klasifikasi pada aktivitas sederhana seperti berjalan, menaiki tangga, menuruni tangga, duduk, berdiri, dan berbaring. Pada penelitian ini juga dilakukan pemilihan hyperparameter terbaik pada masing-masing metode menggunakan metode Grid Search Cross Validation. Hyperparameter terbaik yang didapatkan untuk algoritme PCA adalah dengan nilai k = 207, serta untuk algoritme CIW-ELM dengan jumlah hidden neuron = 600 dan fungsi aktivasi sigmoid. Hasil akurasi yang didapatkan pada penelitian ini adalah 0,957 dan rata-rata f-measure sebesar 0,958 dengan waktu pelatihan selama 0,57 detik. Abstract One of the most important research area is automatic human activity recognition due to its potential application in various other fields such as surveillance, smart environment, and healthcare. Based on various approaches that have been used to recognize human activity, sensor-based techniques are known to be superior to other techniques such as computer vision-based techniques. Sensor-based technique can also be performed using smartphones, but smartphone has disadvantages in performing complex alghorithmic computation. Moreover, feature extraction of the data from the signal captured by the sensor has high dimensions. So, we need a methods to reduce the feature dimensions of the data, and classify the data quickly and accurately. One of the method that can be used to reduce the feature dimensions of data is Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and one of the classification methods that can be used is Computed Input Weight Extreme Learning Machine (CIW-ELM). Therefore, this study will use both methods to classify simple activities such as walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying. In this study, the selection of the best hypeparameter for each method was also carried out using Grid Search Cross Validation. The best hyperparameter obtained for the PCA algorithm is with a value of k = 207, and for the CIW-ELM algorithm with the number of hidden neurons = 600 and the sigmoid activation function.

Dimensional Reduction of QSAR Features Using a Machine Learning Approach on the SARS-Cov-2 Inhibitor Database,Article InfoPublish Date 30 Dec 2022,"Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) is a method that relates the chemical composition of a molecule to its biochemical, pharmaceutical and biological activities. The characteristics of a molecule's chemical constituents, such as chemical descriptors and fingerprints, are necessary to create a good QSAR model. Dimensionality reduction can alleviate the issue of several unnecessary and redundant chemical descriptors and chemical fingerprints in a high-dimensional feature-number data set by shrinking the high-dimensional original space to a low-dimensional intrinsic space. There are two categories of dimensional reduction techniques: feature extraction and feature selection. The dimension reduction approach can be utilized as a starting step in running a QSAR Virtual Screening Model on a dataset of SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor medications to create novel treatments for Covid-19 cases based on machine learning (ML) and the idea of medicinal repurposing. Fe extraction and feature selection are crucial to determining which feature sets should be applied to a specific classification process in QSAR modeling to produce reliable virtual screening results. The SARS-Cov-2 inhibitor drug database's chemical descriptor and chemical fingerprint were extracted using a simple, quick, and accurate method in this work. The total number of selected features is 12122 features. PCA, Missing values, and Random Forest are the techniques employed. The Xgboost Tree Ensemble, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Deep Learning (Artificial Neural Network/Multilayer Perceptron) were used to classify the QSAR modeling on the training and test data. The Random Forest approach, when applied to all chemical descriptors and chemical fingerprint features, along with the XGBoost algorithm, yields the best feature selection results (accuracy value of 0.845 and AUC of 0.904). There are 233 characteristics for the regression QSAR approach and 273 features for the feature selection-based QSAR method of classification. Next, virtual screening of QSAR modeling of prospective drugs for Covid-19 therapy can be done utilizing the outcomes of the characteristics that have been chosen using the Random Forest approach",Jurnal Penelitian Pendidikan IPA (JPPIPA),https://jppipa.unram.ac.id/index.php/jppipa,Universitas Mataram,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/98,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/20"">Agriculture, Biological Sciences &amp; Forestry</a>"

Tinjauan Pemanfaatan Citra Sentinel dan Machine Learning Dalam Pendugaan Volume Tegakan Hutan,Article InfoPublish Date 07 Jan 2023,"This literature review is carried out systematically and aims to identify and analyze research trends, data collections, methods, and frameworks used in estimating forest stand volume (VTH) research with sentinel and (machine learning) ML from 2014 to 2021 so that it can provide answers. on the research questions of this study. The results of the analysis of 24 selected articles based on inclusion-exclusion criteria showed that VTH studies with sentinel and ML generally combine sentinel with other images, such as ALOS-2 L Band, Landsat, ALOS DSM and DEM data. S2-spectral band, S2-vegetation index, slope, S1-backscatter, elevation, are the variables most widely used as predictors. RF (random forest regression), SVR (support vector regression), MLR (multi linear regression) and kNN (k-nearest neighbor) algorithms are the most widely used algorithms. The potential for significantly increasing the accuracy of VTH estimation results can be done by adding environmental factors as a predictor variable.The study of Mauya et al, Reis et al and Chen et al which combines optical, SAR and topographic data, reported a significant increase in the accuracy of VTH estimation.Furthermore Mauya et al suggested that the weighted average approach of pixels in extracting variables from image based on the position of the field plot produces a better estimation model than using the centroid approach Optimizing the use of red edge bands in VTH estimation conducted by Jiang et al, Ahmadi et al and Hu et al, shows a more significant correlation between red edge bands and VTH than other S2-derived features s proves that the modification of the vegetation index formula by replacing the band (NIR) with a red edge band is proven to significantly increase its correlation with stand volume and performs very well on the RF, SVM and MLR algorithms in estimating VTH. The kriging geostatistical method by Chen et al and Bolat concluded that SVR-kriging and Regression-kriging each outperformed SVR and had better accuracy in predicting VTH. AbstrakTinjauan literatur ini dilakukan secara sistematis dan bertujuan untuk mengidentifikasi serta menganalisis tren penelitian, kumpulan data, metode, dan kerangka kerja yang digunakan dalam penelitian pendugaan volume tegakan hutan (VTH) dengan sentinel dan machine learning (ML) tahun 2014 sampai 2021 sehingga dapat memberikan jawaban atas pertanyaan penelitian kajian ini.

Crop yield estimation is part of the management of tea plucking, affecting tea quality and quantity. The constraint in estimating crop yields requires technology that can make the process more effective and efficient. Remote sensing technology and machine learning have been widely used in precision agriculture. Recently, big data processing, especially remote sensing data, machine learning, and deep learning have been carried out using a cloud computing platform. Therefore, we propose using GeoAI, a combination of Sentinel-2A imagery, machine learning, and Google Collaboratory, to predict ready for plucking tea leaves at optimal plucking time at Gunung Mas Plantation Bogor. We used selected bands of Sentinel-2A and extracted more features (i.e., NDVI) as a training set. Then we utilized the tea blocks boundary and tea plucking data to generate labels using Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The classification results were further used to estimate the production of crop tea yield. The RF classifier is able to achieve overall accuracy at 51% and SVM at 54%. Meanwhile, accuracy at optimally aged tea blocks is able to achieve at 75.62% for RF and 52.88% for SVM. Thus, the SVM classifier is better in terms of overall accuracy.

A machine learning approach for driver identification,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Apr 2023,"Driver identification is a momentous field of modern decorated vehicles in the perspective of the controller area network (CAN-Bus). Many conventional systems are used to identify the driver. One step ahead, most of the researchers use sensor data of CAN-Bus but there are some difficulties because of the variation of a protocol of different models of vehicle. We aim to identify the driver through supervised learning algorithms based on driving behavior analysis. To identify the driver, a driver verification technique is proposed that evaluate driving pattern using the measurement of CAN sensor data. In this paper on-board diagnostic (OBD-II) is used to capture the data from CAN-Bus sensor and the sensors are listed under SAE J1979 statement.

MAPPING THE AIR MOISTURE CHANGE IN UNDER CANOPY TREES USING A HEMISPHERICAL AND AERIAL PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES,Article InfoPublish Date 18 Jan 2023,"The essential roles of trees in controlling the local climatic variation, such as air moisture, are still interesting to observe. Therefore, this study must deliver knowledge of the benefits of growing trees and enhance people's awareness of climate change adaptation. Here, the analysis requires several data fields such as hemispherical photography, an aerial photograph of a UAV, and air temperature collected using a wet and dry bulb thermometer, which has converted to air moisture. All these are considered to understand the air moisture change under the trees' canopy during a day observation. The hemispherical photography and aerial photograph of a UAV are processed to measure the tree's canopy size and then used together with interpolated air moisture to map the variation in air moisture distribution in under-canopy trees using random forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The result shows that hemispherical photography describes the ability to control the air moisture change. As its size increases, the air moisture level tends to be higher. It was maintained at more than 70% compared to the area with lower canopy cover. This characteristic is similar to the pattern shown by the RF and ANN.

Simulation of SDN in mininet and detection of DDoS attack using machine learning,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Jun 2023,"Most contemporary businesses are embracing software defined networking (SDN), a developing architecture that enables an aerial-like perspective of the entire network. SDN operates by virtualizing the network and provides advantages including improved performance, visibility, speed, and scalability. SDN attempts to divide the network control plane from the forwarding plane. The control plane, which includes one or more controllers and incorporates complete intelligence, is thought of as the brain of the SDN. However, SDN has challenges with controller vulnerability, flexibility, and hardware security. But distributed denial of service (DDoS) assaults constitutes a serious threat to the SDN. Transmission control protocol-synchronized (TCP-SYN) floods, a common cyberattack that can harm SDNs, can deplete network resources by opening an excessive number of illegitimate TCP connections. In this research, we provide an OpenFlow port statistic-based architecture for machine learning (ML) enabled TCP-SYN flood detection. This research showed that ML models like support vector machine (SVM), Navie Bayes, and multi-layered perceptron can distinguish between regular traffic and SYN flood traffic and can mitigate the impacts of the attacking node on the network.

Machine Learning Algorithms Based on Sampling Techniques for Raisin Grains Classification,Article InfoPublish Date 21 Jan 2023,"Raisin grains are among the agricultural commodities that can benefit health. The production of raisin grains needs to be classified to achieve optimal results. In this case, the classification is carried out on two types of grains, namely Kecimen and Besni. However, inaccurate sample data can affect the performance of the model. In this study, two sampling techniques are proposed: stratified and shuffled. The proposed classification model is RF, GBT, NB, LR, and NN. This study aims to identify the performance of classification models based on sampling techniques. Classification models are applied to the seven-features dataset, and modeling is done by cross-validation. The results of the models were tested with a different amount of test data. The performance of the models was evaluated related to accuracy and AUC. The best outcomes of all models based on stratified sampling were founded on tested data of 40 percent with a mean accuracy of 85.50% and an AUC of 0.921. In comparison, models based on shuffled sampling were founded on test data of 20 percent with a mean accuracy of 88.11% and an AUC of 0.935.

Single Lead EMG signal to Control an Upper Limb Exoskeleton Using Embedded Machine Learning on Raspberry Pi,Article InfoPublish Date 09 Feb 2023,"Post-stroke can cause partial or complete paralysis of the human limb. Delayed rehabilitation steps in post-stroke patients can cause muscle atrophy and limb stiffness. Post-stroke patients require an upper limb exoskeleton device for the rehabilitation process. Several previous studies used more than one electrode lead to control the exoskeleton. The use of many electrode leads can lead to an increase in complexity in terms of hardware and software. Therefore, this research aims to develop single lead EMG pattern recognition to control an upper limb exoskeleton. The main contribution of this research is that the robotic upper limb exoskeleton device can be controlled using a single lead EMG. EMG signals were tapped at the biceps point with a sampling frequency of 2000 Hz. A Raspberry Pi 3B+ was used to embed the data acquisition, feature extraction, classification and motor control by using multithread algorithm. The exoskeleton arm frame is made using 3D printing technology using a high torque servo motor drive. The control process is carried out by extracting EMG signals using EMG features (mean absolute value, root mean square, variance) further extraction results will be trained on machine learning (decision tree (DT), linear regression (LR), polynomial regression (PR), and random forest (RF)). The results show that machine learning decision tree and random forest produce the highest accuracy compared to other classifiers. The accuracy of DT and RF are of 96.36±0.54% and 95.67±0.76%, respectively. Combining the EMG features, shows that there is no significant difference in accuracy (p-value 0.05).

Forecasting the Real Estate Housing Prices Using a Novel Deep Learning Machine Model,Article InfoPublish Date 04 Mar 2023,"There is an urgent need to forecast real estate unit prices because the average price of residential real estate is always fluctuating. This paper provides a real estate price prediction model based on supervised regression deep learning with 3 hidden layers, a Relu activation function, 100 neurons, and a Root Mean Square Propagation optimizer (RMS Prop). The model was developed using actual data collected from 28 Egyptian cities between 2014 and 2022. The model can forecast the price of a real estate unit based on 27 different variables. The model is created in two stages: adjusting the parameters to obtain the best ones using a sensitivity k-fold technique, then optimizing the result. 85 percent of the real estate unit data gathered was used in training and developing the model, while the other 15 percent was used in validating and testing. By using a dropout regularization technique of 0.60 on the model layers, the final developed model had a maximum error of 10.58%. After validation, the model had a maximum error of about 9.50%. A graphical user interface (GUI) tool is developed to make use of the final predictive model, which is very simple for real estate developers and decision-makers to use. Doi: 10.28991/CEJ-SP2023-09-04 Full Text: PDF",Civil Engineering Journal,http://civilejournal.org/index.php/cej,C.E.J Publishing Group,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/823,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/50"">Civil Engineering, Building, Construction &amp; Architecture</a>"

Application Of Machine Learning K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm To Predict Diabetes,Article InfoPublish Date 30 Jun 2023,"Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by high blood sugar (glucose) levels or above abnormal values. This can occur when the body is no longer able to absorb glucose properly or when the intake of glucose is higher than needed. Glucose is the main energy source for the cells of the human body. Glucose that accumulates over the long term in the body can lead to complications and more serious and life-threatening diseases. As a result, patients with diabetes must be predicted prior to the onset of disease complications. Machine learning is one of the branches of artificial intelligence that can be used to provide predictive value to datasets of diabetic patients. The tested dataset has 390 observations with data on cholesterol levels, glucose, HDL cholesterol, cholesterol ratio, age, gender, blood pressure, BMI, waist and hip width with its ratio, and the patient's height and weight as variables.

Impact of Data Balancing and Feature Selection on Machine Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection,Article InfoPublish Date 28 Feb 2023,"Unbalanced datasets are a common problem in supervised machine learning. It leads to a deeper understanding of the majority of classes in machine learning. Therefore, the machine learning model is more effective at recognizing the majority classes than the minority classes. Naturally, imbalanced data, such as disease data and data networking, has emerged in real life. DDOS is one of the network intrusions found to happen more often than R2L. There is an imbalance in the composition of network attacks in Intrusion Detection System (IDS) public datasets such as NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15. Besides, researchers propose many techniques to transform it into balanced data by duplicating the minority class and producing synthetic data. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) algorithms duplicate the data and construct synthetic data for the minority classes. Meanwhile, machine learning algorithms can capture the labeled data's pattern by considering the input features. Unfortunately, not all the input features have an equal impact on the output (predicted class or value). Some features are interrelated and misleading. Therefore, the important features should be selected to produce a good model. In this research, we implement the recursive feature elimination (RFE) technique to select important features from the available dataset. According to the experiment, SMOTE provides a better synthetic dataset than ADASYN for the UNSW-B15 dataset with a high level of imbalance. RFE feature selection slightly reduces the model's accuracy but improves the training speed. Then, the Decision Tree classifier consistently achieves a better recognition rate than Random Forest and KNN.",JOIV : International Journal on Informatics Visualization,http://joiv.org/index.php/joiv,Politeknik Negeri Padang,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/89,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"

During training, a number of distinct models are built, each of which is able to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviours that are included within the dataset. This article proposes a combination of ant colony optimization (ACO) and the firefly approach for feature selection. The final outcome of giving careful thought to the selection of features will eventually result in greater accuracy of categorisation. When classifying various sorts of features, we make use of a wide variety of machine learning (ML) algorithms, including AdaBoost, gradient boost, and Bayesian network (BN), amongst others. The tests and assessments made use of data obtained from three distinct datasets, namely NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS 2017. The degree of performance of an individual may be broken down into its component parts, which include the F1 score, accuracy, precision, and recall. Gradient boost performs far better when it comes to recognising and classifying incursions.",Bulletin of Electrical Engineering and Informatics,http://beei.org/index.php/EEI,Universitas Ahmad Dahlan,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/8,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/100"">Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineering</a>"
Breast cancer detection: an effective comparison of different machine learning algorithms on the Wisconsin dataset,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Aug 2023,"According to the American cancer society, breast cancer is one of the leading causes of women's mortality worldwide. Early identification and treatment are the most effective approaches to halt the spread of this cancer. The objective of this article is to give a comparison of eight machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision tree (DT), ada boost (AB), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting (GB), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) for breast cancer detection. The breast cancer Wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset is being utilized to validate the findings of this study. The comparison was made using the following performance metrics: accuracy, sensitivity, false omission rate, specificity, false discovery rate and area under curve. The LR method achieved a maximum accuracy of 99.12% among all eight algorithms and was compared to other comparable studies in the literature. The five features chosen are used to calculate the model's fidelity-to-interpretability ratio (FIR), which indicates how much interpretability was sacrificed for performance. The uniqueness of this work is the explainability approach taken in the model's performance, which aims to make the model's outputs more understandable and interpretable to healthcare experts.",Bulletin of Electrical Engineering and Informatics,http://beei.org/index.php/EEI,Universitas Ahmad Dahlan,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/8,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/100"">Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineering</a>"
Feature-based real-time distributed denial of service detection in SDN using machine learning and Spark,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Aug 2023,"Recently, software defined networking (SDN) has been deployed extensively in diverse practical domains, providing a new direction in network management by separating the control plane from the data plane. Nevertheless, SDN is vulnerable to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks resulting from its centralized controller. Several studies have been suggested to address the DDoS attacks in SDN utilizing machine learning approaches. However, these approaches are resource-intensive and cause performance degradation since they cannot perform effectively in large-scale SDN networks that generate vast traffic statistics. To handle all these challenges, we build a DDoS attack detection model in SDN using Spark as a big data tool to overcome the limitations of conventional data processing methods. Four machine learning algorithms are employed. The decision tree (DT) is elected to be used for real-time deployment based on the performance results, which indicates that it has the best accuracy of 0.936. The model performance is compared with state-of-the-art and shows an overall better performance.",Bulletin of Electrical Engineering and Informatics,http://beei.org/index.php/EEI,Universitas Ahmad Dahlan,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/8,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/100"">Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineering</a>"

Google Trends and Technical Indicator based Machine Learning for Stock Market Prediction,Article InfoPublish Date 31 Mar 2023,"The stock market often attracts investors to invest, but it is not uncommon for investors to experience losses when buying and selling shares. This causes investors to hesitate to determine when to sell or buy shares in the stock market. The accurate stock price prediction will help investors to decide when to buy or sell their shares. In this study, we propose a new approach to predicting stocks using machine learning with a combination of features from stock price features, technical indicators, and Google trends data. Three well-known machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Multiple Linear regression are used to predict future stock prices. The test results show that the SVR outperformed the MLP and Multiple Linear Regression to predict stock prices for Indonesian stocks with an average MAPE is 0.50%. The SVR can predict the stock price close to the actual price.","Matrik : Jurnal Manajemen, Teknik Informatika, dan Rekayasa Komputer",https://journal.universitasbumigora.ac.id/index.php/matrik,Universitas Bumigora,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/1762,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"

The need for alternative approaches to help the success ratio in matrix acidizing is crucial. This paper demonstrates a modeling technique to improve the success ratio of matrix acidizing in a hydraulic fractured sandstone formation. Supervised machine learning with 4 models of a neural network, logistic regression, tree, and random forest was selected to predict the successfulness of matrix acidizing in hydraulic fracturing. In parallel, multivariate analysis of principal component regression and partial least square regression approach were utilized to predict the oil gain of the job. For qualitative prediction, the results showed that the random forest was the best model to predict the successfulness of the job with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.68 and precision of 0.73 in the training model with 70% of the data. Subsequently, the validation test with the rest of the data (30% data) gave 0.51 AUC and 61% precision.

Susceptible exposed infectious recovered-machine learning for COVID-19 prediction in Saudi Arabia,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Aug 2023,"Susceptible exposed infectious recovered (SEIR) is among the epidemiological models used in forecasting the spread of disease in large populations. SEIR is a fitting model for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread prediction. Somehow, in its original form, SEIR could not measure the impact of lockdowns. So, in the SEIR equations system utilized in this study, a variable was included to evaluate the impact of varying levels of social distance on the transmission of COVID-19. Additionally, we applied artificial intelligence utilizing the deep neural network machine learning (ML) technique. On the initial spread data for Saudi Arabia that were available up to June 25th, 2021, this improved SEIR model was used. The study shows possible infection to around 3.1 million persons without lockdown in Saudi Arabia at the peak of spread, which lasts for about 3 months beginning from the lockdown date (March 21st). On the other hand, the Kingdom's current partial lockdown policy was estimated to cut the estimated number of infections to 0.5 million over nine months.

CORPORATE FINANCIAL DISTRESS PREDICTION USING STATISTICAL EXTREME VALUE-BASED MODELING AND MACHINE LEARNING,Article InfoPublish Date 27 Apr 2023,"The industrial sector plays a leading role in an economy such that the financial stability of companies from this sector be a big concern. Two financial ratios, i.e., the Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) and the Return on Assets (ROA), are used to determine the corporate financial distress conditions. This work considers two schemes for determining financial distress. First, a company is categorized as distressed if either ICR<1 or ROA<0. The second scheme is for when both ICR<1 and ROA<0 are met. The proportion of distressed and non-distressed companies is imbalanced. Our work views the distressed companies (minority class) as a rare event, causing the proportion to be extremely small, such that the Extreme Value Theory can be employed. The so-called Generalized Extreme Value regression (GEVR), developed from GEV distribution, predicts the distressed labels. The GEVR's performance is compared using machine learning with and without feature selection. The feature selection in GEVR uses backward elimination. The model for prediction employs a drift or windowing concept, i.e., using past-period predictors to predict the current response. The empirical results found that the GEVR, with and without the feature selection, provides the best prediction for financial distress.",Media Statistika,https://ejournal.undip.ac.id/index.php/media_statistika,Universitas Diponegoro,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/7,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/80"">Decision Sciences, Operations Research &amp; Management </a>"

"Short-, Medium-, and Long-Term Prediction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions using Wavelet-Enhanced Extreme Learning Machine",Article InfoPublish Date 01 Apr 2023,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. Early prediction of CO2 is critical for developing strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change. A sophisticated version of the extreme learning machine (ELM), the wavelet enhanced extreme learning machine (W-EELM), is used to predict CO2 on different time scales (weekly, monthly, and yearly). Data were collected from the Mauna Loa Observatory station in Hawaii, which is ideal for global air sampling. Instead of the traditional method (singular value decomposition), a complete orthogonal decomposition (COD) was used to accurately calculate the weights of the ELM output layers. Another contribution of this study is the removal of noise from the input signal using the wavelet transform technique. The results of the W-EELM model are compared with the results of the classical ELM. Various statistical metrics are used to evaluate the models, and the comparative figures confirm the superiority of the applied models over the ELM model. The proposed W-EELM model proves to be a robust and applicable computer-based technology for modeling CO2concentrations, which contributes to the fundamental knowledge of the environmental engineering perspective. Doi: 10.28991/CEJ-2023-09-04-04 Full Text: PDF",Civil Engineering Journal,http://civilejournal.org/index.php/cej,C.E.J Publishing Group,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/823,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/50"">Civil Engineering, Building, Construction &amp; Architecture</a>"
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STEP FUNCTION INTERVENTION AND EXTREME LEARNING MACHINE FOR FORECASTING THE PASSENGER’S AIRPORT IN SORONG,Article InfoPublish Date 20 Apr 2023,"This study aims to forecast the number of passengers departing at the domestic departure terminal at Domine Eduard Osok Sorong Airport in 2022 using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method, ARIMA with Step Function Intervention, and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The knowledge of the number of passengers can help the airport prepare facilities. The residual ARIMA model (0,1,0) has no serial correlation (random walk) based on the Ljung-Box test. The MAPE value of the ARIMA model (0,1,0) is 65.47% which means poorly fitted. Because of it, the researchers propose an intervention in the ARIMA model. The RMSE and MAPE ARIMA Intervention ​​(1,0,0) (0,1,0) [12] were 9,027.671 and 35.86%, respectively. Besides, this study also employed the ELM method, which has a MAPE error measurement value of 30.64%. The ELM method has the lowest error measurement results among the three methods. Therefore, the ELM method is suitable for forecasting the number of passengers with predicted values ​​from June to September 2022 as follows: 47985, 37821, 31247, and 33578.

Machine learning classifiers for detection of glaucoma,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Jun 2023,"Glaucoma is a disease that affects the optic nerve. This disease, over a period of time, can lead to loss of vision. Which is known as ‘silent thief of sight’. There are several methods in which the disease can be treated, if detected at an early stage It is not possible for any technology, including artificial intelligence, to replace a doctor. However, it is possible to develop a model based on several classical image processing algorithms, combined with artificial intelligence that can detect onset of glaucoma based on certain parameters of the retinal fundus. This model would play an important role in early detection of the disease and assist the doctor. The traditional methods to detect glaucoma, as efficient as they may be, are usually expensive, a machine learning approach to diagnose from fundus images and accurately classify its severity can be considered to be efficient. Here we propose support vector machine (SVM) method to segregate, train the models using a high-end graphics processor unit (GPU) and augment the hull convex approach to boost the accuracy of the image processing mechanisms along with distinguishing the different stages of glaucoma.

Prediction of Energy Consumption of an Administrative Building using Machine Learning and Statistical Methods,Article InfoPublish Date 01 May 2023,"Energy management is now essential in light of the current energy issues, particularly in the building industry, which accounts for a sizable amount of global energy use. Predicting energy consumption is of great interest in developing an effective energy management strategy. This study aims to prove the outperformance of machine learning models over SARIMA models in predicting heating energy usage in an administrative building in Chefchaouen City, Morocco. It also highlights the effectiveness of SARIMA models in predicting energy with limited data size in the training phase. The prediction is carried out using machine learning (artificial neural networks, bagging trees, boosting trees, and support vector machines) and statistical methods (14 SARIMA models). To build the models, external temperature, internal temperature, solar radiation, and the factor of time are selected as model inputs. Building energy simulation is conducted in the TRNSYS environment to generate a database for the training and validation of the models. The models' performances are compared based on three statistical indicators: normalized root mean square error (nRMSE), mean average error (MAE), and correlation coefficient (R). The results show that all studied models have good accuracy, with a correlation coefficient of 0.90 < R < 0.97. The artificial neural network outperforms all other models (R=0.97, nRMSE=12.60%, MAE= 0.19 kWh). Although machine learning methods, in general terms, seemingly outperform statistical methods, it is worth noting that SARIMA models reached good prediction accuracy without requiring too much data in the training phase. Doi: 10.28991/CEJ-2023-09-05-01 Full Text: PDF",Civil Engineering Journal,http://civilejournal.org/index.php/cej,C.E.J Publishing Group,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/823,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/50"">Civil Engineering, Building, Construction &amp; Architecture</a>"

Software Defect Prediction Based on Optimized Machine Learning Models: A Comparative Study,Article InfoPublish Date 30 Jun 2023,"Software defect prediction is crucial used for detecting possible defects in software before they manifest. While machine learning models have become more prevalent in software defect prediction, their effectiveness may vary based on the dataset and hyperparameters of the model. Difficulties arise in determining the most suitable hyperparameters for the model, as well as identifying the prominent features that serve as input to the classifier. This research aims to evaluate various traditional machine learning models that are optimized for software defect prediction on NASA MDP (Metrics Data Program) datasets. The datasets were classified using k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), decision trees, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), single hidden layer multilayer perceptron (SHL-MLP), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The hyperparameters of the models were fine-tuned using random search, and the feature dimensionality was decreased by utilizing principal component analysis (PCA). The synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was implemented to oversample the minority class in order to correct the class imbalance. k-NN was found to be the most suitable for software defect prediction on several datasets, while SHL-MLP and SVM were also effective on certain datasets. It is noteworthy that logistic regression and LDA did not perform as well as the other models. Moreover, the optimized models outperform the baseline models in terms of classification accuracy. The choice of model for software defect prediction should be based on the specific characteristics of the dataset. Furthermore, hyperparameter tuning can improve the accuracy of machine learning models in predicting software defects.",Teknika,http://ejournal.ikado.ac.id/index.php/teknika,Institut Informatika Indonesia Surabaya,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/2261,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"

Convolutional auto-encoded extreme learning machine for incremental learning of heterogeneous images,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Oct 2023,"In real-world scenarios, a system's continual updating of learning knowledge becomes more critical as the data grows faster, producing vast volumes of data. Moreover, the learning process becomes complex when the data features become varied due to the addition or deletion of classes. In such cases, the generated model should learn effectively. Incremental learning refers to the learning of data which constantly arrives over time. This learning requires continuous model adaptation but with limited memory resources without sacrificing model accuracy. In this paper, we proposed a straightforward knowledge transfer algorithm (convolutional auto-encoded extreme learning machine (CAE-ELM)) implemented through the incremental learning methodology for the task of supervised classification using an extreme learning machine (ELM). Incremental learning is achieved by creating an individual train model for each set of homogeneous data and incorporating the knowledge transfer among the models without sacrificing accuracy with minimal memory resources. In CAE-ELM, convolutional neural network (CNN) extracts the features, stacked autoencoder (SAE) reduces the size, and ELM learns and classifies the images.

DEVELOPMENT OF INDEPENDENT TAEKWONDO TRAINING MACHINE LEARNING WITH 3D POSE MODEL MEDIAPIPE,Article InfoPublish Date 01 Jul 2023,"Taekwondo is a martial art that focuses on punching and kicking movements while upholding the values of discipline, ethics, and good behavior. Discipline is built with routine training to make someone proficient in taekwondo martial arts. Training cannot be carried out flexibly because it must be accompanied by a sabouem to know the correct taekwondo movements. Machine learning can be used as a solution for taekwondo movement recognition by building a learning machine model that recognizes the correct taekwondo movement. The MediaPipe framework has the advantage of being able to recognize human posture with 33 points or landmarks. The research was carried out by conducting a literature study, where similar research was found but only based on the values of the x and y axes. So a problem arises where the majority of taekwondo movements require the z axis to know the correct taekwondo movements. The research was conducted to add z-axis values and change calculations, which were adjusted to reconstruct a training data object in the form of an image into a three-dimensional shape. From this study, it was found that machine learning using the x, y, and z axes is much better for its use, especially when detecting taekwondo movements from different viewpoints from the training data. This research can be developed by enlarging the image dataset and packaging the model into a mobile application so that it can be used for taekwondo training up to taekwondo movement assessment.",Sinkron : Jurnal dan Penelitian Teknik Informatika,https://jurnal.polgan.ac.id/index.php/sinkron,Politeknik Ganesha Medan,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/530,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"
Software Defect Prediction Based on Optimized Machine Learning Models: A Comparative Study,Article InfoPublish Date 30 Jun 2023,"Software defect prediction is crucial used for detecting possible defects in software before they manifest. While machine learning models have become more prevalent in software defect prediction, their effectiveness may vary based on the dataset and hyperparameters of the model. Difficulties arise in determining the most suitable hyperparameters for the model, as well as identifying the prominent features that serve as input to the classifier. This research aims to evaluate various traditional machine learning models that are optimized for software defect prediction on NASA MDP (Metrics Data Program) datasets. The datasets were classified using k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), decision trees, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), single hidden layer multilayer perceptron (SHL-MLP), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The hyperparameters of the models were fine-tuned using random search, and the feature dimensionality was decreased by utilizing principal component analysis (PCA). The synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was implemented to oversample the minority class in order to correct the class imbalance. k-NN was found to be the most suitable for software defect prediction on several datasets, while SHL-MLP and SVM were also effective on certain datasets. It is noteworthy that logistic regression and LDA did not perform as well as the other models. Moreover, the optimized models outperform the baseline models in terms of classification accuracy. The choice of model for software defect prediction should be based on the specific characteristics of the dataset. Furthermore, hyperparameter tuning can improve the accuracy of machine learning models in predicting software defects.",Teknika,http://ejournal.ikado.ac.id/index.php/teknika,Institut Informatika Indonesia,https://garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/publisher/view/522,"<a class=""ui tag label grey mini"" href=""/area/index/60"">Computer Science &amp; IT</a>"
